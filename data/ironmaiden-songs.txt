Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, standing in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

When the world was virgin
Before the coming of men
Just a solar witness
The beginning of the end
From a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And a human race

We are strange believers, all of us
There are stranger truths, immortal lust
We rise from slumber, he calls our name
Recalls our number, abide with pain

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

To God's illusion, which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below

Eternal darkness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master's table, the table's bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Good day, my name is Necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul metal
And I suck the lives from around my bed
My own two sons I gave them breath
And I filled their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgotten
For me eternity is nothing
But a short whileAnother time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night

One way ticket no return
My shooting star so fast it burns
On the edge that you can't see

Let's shoot the moon, you and me
I'm not particular you see
Just a lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the Speed Of Light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shooting plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Running in a human race

I don't know where I don't know when
But somehow back there time again
I'm the edge that you can't see

I'm not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won't be tracking me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the Speed Of Light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the Speed Of Light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the Speed Of Light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the Speed Of Light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the Speed Of Light

We slip into the nightWinter softly falling to the ground
Calmly waiting don’t you hear a sound
When the world has fallen to the depths below
Where the future’s open and the fear has grown
And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown

In the selfish hearts of some
The nightmare’s coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through
Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met
To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor’s anger
Of the lesson ringing true
And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end

Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
Begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It’ll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It’ll be the damnation and end of us all

Where the fools are lying
And the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It’ll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It’ll be the damnation and end of us all

When the world has fallen
And we stand aloneThe morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can’t get out just a feeling of dread
I know this burden's a heavy load
A dark mistake never ending road

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger he counts his stash
The joker’s wild like an impish child
While madame fortune she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search destroy
The ones below human decoy

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one
You hedge your bets the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck be happy sad

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I need somebody to save me

The red and the black
People don’t want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away
The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden’s a heavy load there is no doubt
The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have
The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I need somebody to save meLook for something that is hard to find
Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you're looking for
Heaven's waiting with an open door.

If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It's something that will be whatever our fate.

There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last
There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Is this the last together maybe this time now
We stand together and we're holding the line here
There's nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate

There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last
There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our livesSacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that’s rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts

The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to full fill man’s desire

The power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld

A life that’s full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise
The ultimate sacrifice

Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon

Falling of ages, forest of kings
The search for the truth, the book of souls

The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown

Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

Prophecy of sky gods
The sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon

Falling of ages
Forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins

Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed

Domain of the earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves mayan slaves

Defeat of the dark lords
The ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule

The book of soulsI see the enemy, I know he can't see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score
Took a bullet in my brain
Inside I'm m the king of pain
Outside you will fear my name
I ride a blood red triplane

Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting beam attack
I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day

Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one way trainWandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that's been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven's call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men

Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows

He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man's laugh
The fear that? s inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them

Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill

The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I'll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I'll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

Into the valley of death
Fear no evil
We will go forward no
Matter the cost
Into the valley of death
Follow me now
Bring me your souls
And I'll make it our last

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die

Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they beginAll alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There’s something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Who motivates the motivator
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all ok
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown
Oh
Tears of a clownLike a man without a home
Watching people come and go
Carry on their daily lives
Without a thought for the ones alone
Cast the dream aside like throwing
A pebble into the ocean tide
And I? m feeling so alone again
Free the angry from their pain
Free the captives from the chains
Cast aside the doubt that
Nothing good can come their way again
Living in a world of lies
No matter how or hard we try
Living life without a dream today

Looking through a mist of truth
That we believe an elusive cloud
The things we find are hard to say now
That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die

Now we need to know the truth now
Open our eyes that we can see
So we live and breathe again
Better days for you and me
Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away

As one turns against the other
With a brother against brother
Situation like no other it? s a picture of despair

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don? t know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what? s ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those
Who don? t know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what? s ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no moreTo ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion

Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Related giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
The millionth chance they laughed, to take down his majesty's craft
To India they say, magic carpet float away, an October fateful day

Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His majesty's airship, the r101

She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum rolled tight, a canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come

The fury yet to come

In the gathering gloom, a storm rising in the west
The coxswain stared into the
We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for the politicians he can't be late
The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch

She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
A fragile outer cover, her achilles would become

An achilles yet to come

Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king, and an airship creed

The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground
Said the coxswain, sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight
Said the captain, damn the cargo, we'll be on our way tonight
Groundsmen cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast
Baptising with her water, from the ballast fore and aft

Now she slips into our past

Feeling the wind as it blows you
Feeling the beams as they pass you along
Watching the channel below you
Lower and lower, into the night

Lights are passing below you
Northern France, asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you
A million to one, that's what he said

Reaper standing beside you
Wind inside cuts to the bone
Panicked to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves

The cover is ripped and she's flooding
Rain is flooding into the hold
Bleeding to death and she's falling
Lifting gas is draining away

We're down lads, came a cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last

Here lie their dreams as they stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines they run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on

Dreams live on
Dreams live on
Ooh

Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast
1840 souls, who came to die in france[Part 1: Satellite 15]
I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice

The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from satellite
As my life
Flashes right in front of me

Try again
Must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time

Not much time
Hear my call
Please get through
I am here

[Part 2: The Final Frontier]
I'm stranded in space
I'm lost without trace
I haven't a chance of getting away

Too close to the sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait till my time comes

I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time afresh

[Chorus]
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

If I could survive
To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all

Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

[Chorus]

There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me

Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

[Chorus]

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontierAs he travels on the beast of Burden
Moving up along the mountain side
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride

As he journeys across mountain passes
And significant sweeps overhand
His reflection of the beauty around him
Feeling empty inside

He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

He's searching for the answer now
Is something that he's managed to avoid up 'till now
Looking for the conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner or later

Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strife for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give him now
His life and time is the only things that he has

Life is is not a rehearsal, only has this the one
Chance to get it right
Living really is only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
With all the pain of lying too early in the grave

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now, we'll be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now, we'll be his saving grace

(solo)

Just to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but he's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is impossible to change such a lot

He's taken someone?s life away
There's not a day that goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
From the good book says an eye for an eye

In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him still his grave
No-one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now, we'll be his only way
understand, no good to run away
Hear us now, we'll be his saving grace
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now, we'll be his only way
understand, no place to run away
Hear us now, we'll be his saving grace

Far, far away
The man who would be king
Far, far away
The man who would be king

Crédito:  HellequinI'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
The words escape me when I try to speak
Tears flow, but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, hallowed be thy name
Yeah, hallowed by thy name
YeahWe are not the son's of god
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning

Shadow finger rise above
Higher thing's stab the desert sky
Oh behold the power of men
On his tower ready for the fall

Clapping hand's together well
Raiser cities built on living hell
Trying to raise the suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell

Out of the universe
A strange life is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Yellow sun, its evil twin
In the black the winds deliverd him
We will sleep to soul's within
At a siege a nuclear gust is riven

Out of the universe
A strange life is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns

Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns

(solo)

Bury your moral's
And bury your dead
Bury your hand that has sinned
E=mc^2 you can relate
How we make god with our hand's

Whatever would Albert have said to his god
about how he made war with the sun
E=Mc^2 you can relate
how we make god with our hand's

All nations are rising
Threw acid bell's of love and hate
Chain medals of satan
Uncertainty brought us all to this

All nations are rising
Threw acid bell's of love and hate
Cold fusion and Fury

(solo)

Your body can't go on this way
I was preachen of a small pray
In the bunker where we'll die
We are the executioner's that lie

Bombers launched with no recall
Minute warning of the missiles of old
Take a look at your last day
Guessing you won't have the time to cry

Out of the universe
A strange life is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns

Holy Father, we have sinned.[Intro]
Let me tell you 'bout my life
Let me tell you 'bout my dreams
Let me tell you 'bout the things that happened
Always real to me

Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why

[Verse 1]
Why should these curses be laid upon me?
I won't be forgiven 'till I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
Paid for my sins, for the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone, reach for Heaven from Hell

[Chorus]
My sins are many
My guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing
Of hiding what I know

I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh heavy down on me

[Verse 2]
I know they're crying for help, reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnation of me
Live again

[Chorus]
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell

[Bridge]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Someone to save me
Something to save me from my Hell
A destination away from this nightmare

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this HellAre you a man of peace
Or man of holy war
Too many sides to you
Don't know which any more
So many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe again

A life that's made to breath
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain corruption
Bad or good intent
A wolf in a sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or someone that would belive
A holy war winner

They fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only god would know
And as he lies in heaven
Or it could be in hell
I feel he's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes is seems more like the blind leading blind
It brings upon us more of famine death and war
You know religion has a lot of answers for

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
And as their spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins

And all because of it you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count the city fires burn
Somewhere there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man
Tell me why, tell me why

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

For the greater good of God

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

For the greater good of God

He gave his life for us he fell upon the cross
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again
Tell me why, tell me whyI'm gonna organise some changes in my life, 
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past,
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road, 
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel like I can be anything, 
that I might ever wish to be,  
and fantasize just what I want to to be, 
make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way. 
Out on my own again I'm on my way out on the road again,

When I remember back to how that things used to be, 
and I was stuck inside a shroud of misery I felt I disappeared so deep inside my self 
I couldn't find a way to break away the hell

When I'm feeling down and low, 
I vow I'll never be the same again, 
I just remember what I am, and visualize what I'm gonna be,

I'm on my way. Out on my own again, 
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,

I'm gonna break away, I'm out on my own, 
I'm out on my own, gonna break away, breaking away,

I'm on my way, out my own again, 
I'm on my way, out on the road again, I'm on my way, out on my own again, 
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,When I was wandering in the desert 
And was searching for the truth 
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name 
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again 
I turned my face towards the barren sun 

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground 
They are sealed and are now washed away 

[Chorus:]
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away 
You tell me we can start the rain 
You tell me that we all can change 
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far away 

[Chorus]

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me 
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves 
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives 
They are sealed and now far awayThere's a darkened sky before me 
There's no time to prepare 
Salvage a last horizon 
But no regrets from me 

Maybe I'll be back some other day 
To live again just who can say 
In what shape or form that I might be 
Just another chance for me 

A hurried time no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusion 
And wishing all my life away 
No-one can stop me now 

Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I'd like to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Someday maybe I'll wait till then 

No more lies...

They're all sitting at my table 
Talking tall and drinking wine 
Their time is up just like me 
But they just don't know it yet 

So just a word of warning 
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from 
I've got my eye on you 

The clock is fast, the hour is near 
Eventful past is everclear 
My life is set, the time is here 
I think I'm coming home 

No more lies...

A hurried time, no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusions 
And wishing all your life away 
No-one can stop me now 

Time is up it couldn't last 
But there's more things I have to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Don't tell me that this is the end

No more lies...I stand alone in this desolate space 
In death they are truly alive 
Massacred innocence, evil took place 
The angels were burning inside 

Centuries later I wonder why 
What secret they took to their grave 
Still burning heretics under our skies 
Religion's still burning inside 

[Chorus]
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur 
Blood on the stones of the citadel 

As we kill them all so God will know his own 
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne 
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal 
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross 

Templar believers with blood on their hands 
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand 
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
To stand with the catharsis, to die and be free 

The book of Old Testament crippled and black 
Satan - his weapon is lust 
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of lies

The perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed 
Religion's still burning inside 

[Chorus]

As we kill them all so God will know his own 
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne 
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal 
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross 

Templar believers with blood on their hands 
Joined in the chorus to kill on command 
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
Still running herretics under our skies

As we kill them all so God know his own 
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust 
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin 
No passover feast for the cursed within 

Facing the sun as they went to their grave 
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave 
Death is the price for your soul's liberty 
To stand with the catharsis and to die and be free 

[Chorus]Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
Drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 

To this day I guess I'll never know 
Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more 
'Til I dance with the deadWeaving a thread round your heart and your soul 
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal 
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight 
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead 
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed 
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap 
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek 

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame 
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
You can't blame a madman if you go insane 
Give me the strength so I carry on 

[Chorus]
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame 
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
You can't blame a madman if you go insane 
Give me the strength so I carry on 

[Chorus]Bleeding you dry from the start 
The sum of my parts
To give it away 
New life in a day 
Some new Frankenstein 
Damned for all time 

Cursed by the angel who fell 
Who saves me from hell? 
And who is my god? 
And where is my soul? 
Too tired to jump too young to run 

[Bridge]
Never ending, forever searching 
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
Always seeking, always asking 
Questions right from the start 

[Chorus:]
Out beyond the new frontier 
Playing god without mercy, without fear 
Create a beast, made a man without a soul 
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man? 
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man? 

I want to end my life now
But I don't know how 
Recycled again a lifetime of pain 
The spawn of a man 
The devil has planned 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]In a foreign field he lay 
Lonely soldier unkown grave 
On his dying words he prays 
Tell the world of Paschendale 

Relive all that he's been through 
Last communioun of his soul 
Rust your bullets with his tears 
Let me tell you 'bout his years 

Laying low in a blood filled trench 
Kill tim 'til my very own death 
On my face I can feel the falling rain 
Never see my friends again 

In the smoke in the mud and lead 
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread 
Soon be time to go over the wall 
Rapid fire and the end of us all 

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire 
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire 
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb 
Be reunited with my dead friends soon 

Many soldiers eighteen years 
Drown in mud no more tears 
Surely a war no-one can win 
Killing time about to begin 

Home, far away 
From the war, a chance to live again 
Home, far away 
But the war, no chance to live again 

The bodies of ours and our foes 
The sea of death it overflows 
In no man's kand god only knows 
Into jaws of death we go 

Crucified as if on a cross 
Allied troops they mourn their loss 
German war propaganda machine 
Such before has never been seen 

Swear I heard the angels cry 
Pray to god no more may die 
So that people know the truth 
Tell the tale of Paschendale 

Cruelty has a human heart 
Everyman does play his part 
Terror of the men we kill 
The human heart is hungry still 

I stand my ground for the very last time 
Gun is ready as I stand in line 
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow 
Rush of blood and over we go 

Blood is falling like the rain 
It's crimson cloak unveils again 
The sound of guns can't hid their shame 
And so we die on Paschendale 

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire 
Running straight at the cannon fire 
Running blind as I hold my breath 
Say a prayer symphony of death 

As we charge the enemy lines 
A burst of fire and we go down 
I choke a cry but no-one hears 
Fell the blood go down my throat 

Home, far away 
From the war, a chance to live again 
Home, far away 
But the war, no chance to live again 

See my spirit on the wind 
Across the lines beyond the hill 
Friend and foe will meet again 
Those who died at Paschendale Everybody's waiting for something to happen 
Everybody's waiting for something to see 
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters 
Everyone's waiting for news on TV 

Winding lives at the end of the spiral 
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill 
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening 
Everybody wants to be in at the kill 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end of time 

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing 
Everyone's looking for the reason why 
Everyone's hoping for life everafter 
Everyone's looking at death from the sky 

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen 
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes 
Everyone's praying but no one's believing 
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end

[Chorus]
So I watch and I wait 
And I pray for an awnser 
An end to the strife and the world's misery 
But the end never came 
And we're digging the graves 
And we're loading the guns for the kill 

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?

[Chorus]

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand
Future memory of our tragedy?I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more 
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart 
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause 
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all 

And all the politicians and their hollow promises 
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it 
The working man pays everything for their mistakes 
And with his life too if there was to be a war 

[Chorus]
So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only got one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it 
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream 

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday 
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday 
Assailants know just how much further they can go 
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low 

[Chorus]

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home 
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes 
So now the criminal they launch right in our face 
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace 

Despondent public worries, where it will all end?
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend 
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst 
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just 

[Chorus]From the red sky of the east 
To the sunset in the west 
We have cheated death 
And he has cheated us 

But that was just a dream 
And this is what it means 
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermore 

And the fragment remains of our memories 
And the shadows remain with our hands 
Deep gray, came to mourn 
All the colors of the dawn 
Will this journeyman's day be his last? 

[Chorus:]
I know what I want 
And I say what I want 
And no one can take it away 
I know what I want 
And I say what I want 
And no one can take it away 

But the memory still remains 
All the past years not so strange 
Our winter times are like a silent shroud 
And the heartbeat of the day 
Drives the mist away 
And winter's not the only dream around 

In your life you may choose desolation 
And the shadows you build with your hands 
If you turn to the light 
That is burning in the night 
Then the journeyman's day has begun 

[Repeat chorus, 5th verse, chorus]I am the man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

And When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

Have you run your fingers down
the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's
watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's
someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

[solo]

Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am the man who walks aloneWhen a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost

At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these day
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change

[Chorus]
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line draw between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes

[Chorus]
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

[Chorus]
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

The thin line between love and hateRoll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings and the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
And what will the next day bring?

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send an Angel to mend?

Best make decisions, before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reigns
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose, but so much to gain
A little danger, it goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to Heaven is ready and waiting
Or straight down to Hell, can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone

[Chorus]
Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?
(repeat 3x)

[Chorus] (whispered)

[Chorus]

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned but
Still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take?
Decisions to make
Arrive on the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait?
It may be too late

[Chorus]

Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

[Chorus][Chorus 1]
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night comes down

[Verse 1]
Feel someone's watching you
You've got to get away
Is it the first time you've ever felt this scared?
Feel the adrenaline pump
Your heart begins to race
Begin to run now
The sweat runs down your face

[Verse 2]
Don't know which way to turn
You'd better hide yourself
He's getting close now
You'd better improvise
Just hope you never reach the point of no return
Could be the last time  you see the light of day

[Chorus 2]
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down

[Bridge 1]
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

[Bridge 2]
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

[Bridge 2] 3x

Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to

[Chorus 2]

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger[Harris]

Sometimes it makes me wonder
Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me saddened
Always it makes me angry but...

When you can see it happening
The madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems to powerless to act...

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day a new toll

Another  assassination
The same day a new creation
But what are they coming into
Security of a world that brings...

One day another killing
Somewhere there's someone starying
Another a savage raping
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day it goes on

Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a geaserfire

They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands
Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat
from my brow
But it's not the fear 'cos
I'd rather go now

Trying to visualize the horrors that
will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's
to be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done- on Earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the
reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror, corruption must end
And we know, deep down there's
no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangersI'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
The words escape me when I try to speak
Tears flow, but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, hallowed be thy name
Yeah, hallowed by thy name
YeahHoney its getting close to midnight
And all the myths are in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door invite me around

[Chorus]
Bring your daughter,bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go,let her go,let her go.
Bring your daughter,bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go,let her go,let her go.
Let her go

Honey its getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your kneees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know I'm coming soon

[Chorus]

Pick up your foolish pride,no going back
No where,no way,no place to hide

[solo]

Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, To the slaughter.
Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Bring me your daughter, To the slaughter.

Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, To the slaughter.
Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, Bring me your daughter, Fetch your daughter, To the slaughter.

[Chorus]X2I'm gonna organise some changes in my life, 
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past,
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road, 
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel like I can be anything, 
that I might ever wish to be,  
and fantasize just what I want to to be, 
make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way. 
Out on my own again I'm on my way out on the road again,

When I remember back to how that things used to be, 
and I was stuck inside a shroud of misery I felt I disappeared so deep inside my self 
I couldn't find a way to break away the hell

When I'm feeling down and low, 
I vow I'll never be the same again, 
I just remember what I am, and visualize what I'm gonna be,

I'm on my way. Out on my own again, 
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,

I'm gonna break away, I'm out on my own, 
I'm out on my own, gonna break away, breaking away,

I'm on my way, out my own again, 
I'm on my way, out on the road again, I'm on my way, out on my own again, 
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and Evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done(Harris)  

Tough of the track,
With the wind,
And the rain that's beating down on your back.
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound
Is ringing in your head,
With every step you tread,
And every breath you take,
Determination makes
You run,
Never stop,
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop,
Keep the pace,
Hold the race,
Your mind is getting clearer,
You're over halfway there but the miles
Just never seem to end
As if you're in a dream,
Not getting anywhere.
It seems so futile.

Chorus:
Run, on and on,
Run, on and on,
The loneliness of the long distance runner.

I've got to keep running the course,
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,
I've got to keep going, be strong,
Must be so determined and push myself on.

Run over stiles, across fields,
Turn to look at who's on your heels,
Way ahead of the field,
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes,
You reach the final stretch,
Ideals are just a trace,
You feel like throwing the race,
It's all so futile.

Chorus:
Run, on and on,
Run, on and on,
The loneliness of the long distance runner.Was many years ago that I left home and came this way,
I was a young man full of hopes and dreams,
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained,
Sometimes things ain't what they seem,
No brave new world, no brave new world,
No brave new world, no brave new world.

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky,
My spirit wanders endlessly,
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why,
Hear me calling, rescue me,
Set me free, set me free,
Lost in this place and leave no trace.

Chorus:
Stranger in a strange land,
Land of ice and snow,
Trapped here in this prison, yeah!
Lost and far from home.

One hundred years have gone and men again they came that way,
To find the answer to the mystery,
They found his body lying where it fell on that day,
Preserved in time for all to see,
No brave new world, no brave new world,
Lost in this place, and leave no trace.

Chorus:
Stranger in a strange land,
Land of ice and snow,
Trapped here in this prison, yeah!
Lost and far from home.Revolution in their minds the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through, yeah

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear, yeah

So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah

(Children of the grave)Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
See his eyes as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares
of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and
the Mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name,
hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and
the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and North across the sea
Sailing on and on and North 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame the bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on and on at sea,
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me.

"Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."

There, calls the Mariner,
there comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind
in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See...she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she life in Death,
they throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then...crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She...She, Life in Death,
She lets him live, her chosen one.

"One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
and cursed me with his eye
four times fifty living men
(and I heard nor sigh nor groan),
with heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one."

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak
and they're lifeless in their eyes.

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and
the Mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilots boat, his son and the hermit.
Penance of life will fall onto Him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins.

The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.I remember it as plain as day
although it happened in the dark of the night.
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
and it was cold it was starting to rain.
And then I heard a piercing scream
and I rushed to the scene of the crime
but all I found was the butchered remains
of two girls lay side by side.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
run before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
at last there's someone heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all.
But I must have got some blood on my hands
because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
and like a fool I started running away.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
am I ever gonna be free.

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.
All France is looking for me.
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
down the south to Italy.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home.

Well I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of...

Murders in the Rue Morgue
running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
running from the arms of the law

Murders in the Rue Morgue
running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
am I ever gonna be free

It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
It'd get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
they're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home.Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul 
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal 
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight 
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead 
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed 
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap 
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek 

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame 
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
You can't blame a madman if you go insane 
Give me the strength so I carry on 

[Chorus]
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads 
Show you the gates of tomorrow 

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame 
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
You can't blame a madman if you go insane 
Give me the strength so I carry on 

[Chorus]
