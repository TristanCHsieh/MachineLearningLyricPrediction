It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion

I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the east side of the city that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from your man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Yeah, looking back on it at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion

She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion"That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog. "

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision
Been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait
Until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted
all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the Bar exam
I drove in the snow for you?
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you

[Hook]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl
How 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Aww, you thought you had it all figured out back then, girl
How 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now?
Yeah, girl, how? bout now, how 'bout now
Girl what 'bout now girl, how 'bout now?


[Verse 2]
Always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from acting, I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you Cds of my new shit
You be like "who's this? "
I be like "me, girl", you be like "oh word, true shit? "
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Hook]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl
How 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Aww, you thought you had it all figured out back then, girl
How 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now?
Yeah, girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now
Girl what 'bout now girl, how 'bout now?Https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/trust-issues-feat.-vee-tha/id959131298(Refrão)
Why you keep askin' me about her?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with right now
Got a lot to say
And that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now

(Refrão)
Why you keep askin' me about her?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with right now
Got a lot to say
And that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now

Spendin' all my days on the Eastside of
Forgettin' who I was on the other side of
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
See I got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm tired but I invited myself to hold on
Those nights when you need someone else call me over
You can be the one to take control call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

Call on me, call on me
Call on me, call on me, call on me
Call on me
Call on me, call on me
Call on me
Call on me, call on me
Call on me, call on me
Call on me
Cause I'll always be there for you
Call on me
You can call on me
You can call on me
You can call on me
You can call on me
You can call on me
You can call on me
As long as I'm around you can call on me
As long as I'm around you can call on me[Verse 1]
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I gotta email today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

[Hook]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

[Verse 2]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely too

[Hook]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

[Hook]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

[Outro]
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like youI don't know how to be angel like
Cannot fly
Only tattooed wings on my human skin
Velvet ropes round my neck
Halo fell off my head
I don't live by rules
Don't believe in truth

People talk, people stare
Heaven calls, I don't care
Let me just take a bite

Welcome to club paradise
Welcome to club paradise

Here's to you, here's to me
To the things that you keep
From us
You could be a friend
With your demons
A toast to the free
To the misfits and creeps
We're the devil ones
But the devil's gone

People talk, people stare
Heaven calls, I don't care
Let me just take a bite

Welcome to club paradise
Welcome to club paradise

All these innocent people
It makes me sick
I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't nobody's born sacred
I don't wanna live to be a Goddess

Welcome to club paradise
Club paradise
Welcome to club paradise[Hook]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

[Interlude]
Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

[Verse]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what’s up with y'all?
I hate calling the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to, did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember? I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains? The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not saying I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

[Hook]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

[Interlude]
Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all, tonight
I got plans, I got a certain lust, for life
And as it stands, everything is going as right
As it can; they tryna shoot down my flight
Before it lands...before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)
My ex sendin' late night text
Cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin in the cold—ah yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all... in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Every time... that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh...and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux
I don't really give a fuck and we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think... of today... as the past
It's funny when you comin in first
But you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

[Outro]
Throw your ones up in the aiiir
Throw your ones up in the air for her, ooh-oh
Throw your ones up, in the air
Throw your ones up[Drake - Verse 1]
Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Drake - Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Drake - Verse 3]
We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied wit a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin right, all season
But you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight is prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh[Sample: Notorious B.I.G]
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

[Intro]
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Hook]
I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics, I can't live and hold the camera
Someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed
To pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
Everybody talks and everybody listen
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh they did Poe, at least they tried to
And that's what happens
When you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to nahh
But 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Boy, in my city I'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause this 'Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel
Problem with these other niggas they ain't never real
Yea ... that's all I can say[Intro]
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them, but
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

[Hook]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause—

[Hook]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot

[Hook]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

[Outro]
Uhh, ah yea
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are
(I got you, got you)[Verse 1]
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
(All you ever asked me for was time, whoa)

[Bridge]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]

[Verse 2]
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

[Bridge]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]

[Verse 3]
The girl or the world?
You see someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all
Do I really got to choose?
What good is all the cash
If it doesn't buy time
And what good is being famous
If I'm never on your mind
Nights fallen, lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going
Is it worth it? That decision
Because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance, I swear

[Hook]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5][Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget them and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't
Cause

[Break]

You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone try not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a slang
Call me "Heartbreak Drake", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest; as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yea, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me

[Outro]
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
And everybody wanna ask
What type of act you putting on, like
Man[Verse 1]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I am confident and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask...

[Hook]
Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?
Brand New [5x]
Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?
Brand New [6x]
Girl
(Aye Aye Aye)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Is anything I'm doing Brand New?
New [5x]
Is everything I'm doing to late?
Late [3x]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, Am I too late?

[Fading with ad libs by Drake][Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach
Just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself!
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
...I'm next to blow -- pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love - X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prol'ly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I gotcha dream girl ridin in ya dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin
I hope they document what I'm becomin
Congratulations

[Verse 2: Drake]
So whatchu want an award or sum'hin?
I'm at the private airport boardin sum'hin
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if ya bluffin
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a Monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world records - no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or sum'hin
My deal like Weezy first week, one point sum'hin
...And my verses gettin stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it dooow-haaaah-owwwn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass -- PAUSE
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck wit y'all, then don't bo-ther him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't fa-ther them
Right, uh

[Verse 3: Drake]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
...Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off yo' chest~!"
...and I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin, I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office - same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's crack!
Aiyyo Drizzy, you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like, "Congratulations - it's crack!"
Yah
It's crack, hehe, congratulations
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!I been waitin' on this yeah
All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces
But there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love?
Well, that's sure to be in question
My mount rushmore is me
With four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a

I've had real philly niggas
Try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the gold
And talk about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys
That wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention
That's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label
I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times
When I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times
I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die
When no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life
For some content
That's the type of lottery
That could get your top picked

I am a cream of the crop, nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my mollies pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I'll tee with the stars
And I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark
Wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked
There's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to
Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas
That they caught with it
Rip my niggas that they caught without it

This just a intro
Let me not get ahead of myself
This is god's plan, young man
You said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve
For whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like bernie mac
He dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself
And I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama
And deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie
It severed itself
This just the intro
Let me not get ahead of myselfLook
I just flipped the switch (flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doing this
Bodies start to drop (hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ay
This a rollie not a stopwatch
Shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot
Shit got super hot
Give me my respect, give me my respect
I just took it left like I'm ambidextrous
Bitch I move through london with the eurostep
Gotta sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me cause I'm going (outta there I'm gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm lebron?
Servin' up a pack, serving' up a pack
Niggas pulling' gimmicks
Cause they scared to rap
Funny how they shuck, ay got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself take a look
I'm a bar spitta, I'm hard hitta
Yeah I'm light skinned
But I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a weak splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgiving wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin wrong with em, got em' all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah I am what I am
I don't have no time
For no misunderstandings again
This a rollie not a stopwatch
Shit don't ever stop
Future took the business and ran it for me
I let ollie take the owl told him
Brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop
And that's standard for me
Like I went blind dog you gotta hand it to me
Prayed, then I prayed again
Had a moment but it came and went
You don't wanna play with him
They'll be mourning you like 8am
Pinky ring till I get a wedding ring
Love my brothers cut em in on anything
And you know it's king slime drizzy man

Either hand is the upper hand
Got a? on my other hand
This shit a hundred bands
Palace look like buckingham
Bills so big I call em williams
Shit go crazy got trill ya for real
They been trying me
But I'm resilient for real
I can't go in public like civilian for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge man that's hardly an expense
I'm claiming checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit man I hardly do percents
A big part of me resent niggas
That I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got
And man it's hard to be content
Fuck they got what they got going on
I gotta represent
This a rollie not a stopwatch
Shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot
Shit got super hotElevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka pass a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in better weight
Thinking how I make all this happen
For myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real
Man, it can't be

Yeah, yeah
If you need me, you can call me
I stay busy making money
You know what is on my mind
All I think about is hunnids
I stay busy working on me, homie
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type
That likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is going off
I don't know patience
I got a chance
Then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
See the future when I get wavy (wavy [?] )
But I couldn't picture being champagne
When I would buy that shit
And save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with ms. craten
That lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifing braden
When I was pumping gas on road trips
To go from cincinnati on to dayton
I couldn't gage it
I wanna thank god
For working way harder than satan
He's playing favoritesYou've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this
And tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew
It would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me
Until I'm gone
And even then the thing
That comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling
I had it first
Meeting all my heroes
Like seeing how magic works
The people I looked up
Are to going from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even
When they rehearse
Working in the land of the free
The home and the brave
I gotta bring my brothers
Or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads
That these niggas paved
And they don't like
That it's written all on they face
Ion't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays
For the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good hearted people are takin' it too extremes
Leavin' me
And limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask
What's their motive and makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?

You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Missing out on my years
It's time when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missing out on my days
Scrolling through life and fishing for praise
Opinions from total strangers
Take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end
Of the shade

Most times it's just somebody's that's underage
That's prolly just alone and afraid
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else
Can feel they pain
I always hear people complain
About the place they live
That all the people here fake
And they got nothin' to give
'cause they been starin'
At somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city
Seem more exciting than it is
I know a girl who's one goal was to visit rome
Then she finally got to rome
And all she did was post pictures
For people at home
'cause all that mattered was impressin'
Everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out
For help but her latest caption is
Leave me alone
I know a girl happily married
'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures
From places that she's flown
To post later
And make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hiding my kid from the world
I was hiding the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up
And looked the debate
Until you starin'
At your seat you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life
I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones
I can call
They always ask
Why let the story run if it's false?
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles
When you give 'em an inch
All these followers
But who gon' follow me to the end
I guess I'll make it to the end
And I'ma find out then

You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens aboveYeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 Am to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Guess I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ay, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ay, 'nessed
Might go down a G. O. D., yeah, wait

She say, "Do you love me? " I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies

God's plan, God's plan

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta time, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye
He done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin'
if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me
she just puttin' on a front
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in the flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (that I know)

If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it wit' a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

Ayo blast that shit, Max
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah

Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps, them boys be crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it I do not mean a accident
I'm, I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel, I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Yeah

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's Rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisce?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert, the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

(Yeah) no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oohAyy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy

Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This's and that's, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real
But they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

You know what I'm sayin'? (woo)
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'? (gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah)

Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yo, get close enough to hov, smell like a kilo still
First album 26, I ain't need no deal
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no shine
First rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, off-white, lookin' like soft white on 'em, heh
You know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Said I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe everything
That you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how you not be a hov fan?
I'm what meech shoulda been
I'm what supreme didn't become
If alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like young
I got your president tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed x, let zimmerman live, shh, s-streets is done

You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?Treat you like princess, rest in heaven diana
Peaking my interest, she got peak like montana

Where all your good manners?
Reply with pals to trees
Honestly, I can't stand ya

Ohh, ohh
You got' make me turn up on you
Ohh, ohh
You got' make me turn up on you

What you thought of me
Never had me missing a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it's free
People only as tough
As they phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my peace
You might not agree with me

Ohh, ohh
You got' make me turn up on you
Ohh, ohh
You got' make me turn up on youI think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise and now
I'd rather know ahead of time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started and we're already done

Yeah, you say I led you on
But you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them
So they can't see you liking someone
Just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to ending up
With someone just like
How can you be angry on a night in july
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusing me
Don't have me wasting my time
Yeah, you said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started and we're already done
I kept you decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I
Breaking my heart, tearing me apart
Breaking me down when I'm already out
Breaking my heart
Breaking my heart- breaking my heart
Breaking my heart- breaking my heart
Brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea
Breaking my heart, tearing me apart
Breaking me down when I'm already down
Breaking my heart
Breaking my heart- breaking my heart
Breaking my heart- breaking my heart
Brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea
Brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea- brea

You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in july
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusing me
Don't have me wasting my time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already doneAye
Yeah
Yeah

Leaving me
Dippin' out on me
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly learned yourself through me
Already gave you what you needed, I guess
I guess, yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody
'cause I don't wanna hurt nobody
Did it over text, didn't call me
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody, yeah

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded
Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You tryna come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous
You got something real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded
Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You tryna come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous
You got something real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')

Yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Aye
Told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours
To your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time
But I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's
The same as being stuck
And like comes with the inkin'
You're getting under my skin
Pretty little young thing
Had a nigga coughing, got me too excited
Yeah
You played me
You played me, you played me
Low down, dirty
Shameful, crazy
I needa know how new nigga you got
Does the same thing I do
For a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pcitures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazing
That's besides the point I'm making
You're way too opinionated
Have to force it, have to fake it
You have potential, I could've shaped it
You went and caved in
We could've waited
I wasn't rushing
Differences in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I must've changed it
Shifted your focus, lense lookin' jaded

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded
Most of these things, I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You tryna come back when you famous
(back around, back around)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stopYeah
Turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more

I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie
I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room
With you instead on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you fell alright

Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (yeah)

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse

You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Too high to handle
Things will castled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mindIt's your fuckin' birthday

It's a fuckin' celebration (oh, oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh, oh

It's your birthday, baby
It's your birthday, yeah
Who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, reese's, don't be rediculous
Just say your piece and peace up like ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than anita
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to

To be, to feel
And fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

It's a fuckin' celebration (oh, oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control

Gg, cc's all on you
It's your month and you know it

And you know it's real
Don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say: play this shit, they better play it

Haven't been official in a long time

Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try to get you off my mind

In a whip so low
No one's gotta know (after dark)
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore (after dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands
(after dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

Late night like left eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause
I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (after dark)

In a whip so low
No one's gotta know (no one's gotta know), after dark
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more), after dark
You can
Put your phone down
You're gonna need two hands (ooh, yeah), after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "fuck these niggas, " rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "do anything, but just don't lie to me. "
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the shorty, we got ghosts
And when it's time to duck it we can go

In a whip so low
No one's gotta know (no one's gotta know), after dark

Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, head grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like
Like evil angel, like vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know
I need you to be open like kay's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound
Like waves hitting, soothing
Keep it right there, no moving
Make my way around the baseses
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest
I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (high)
I like best when you're fresh faced
And no foundation
Willing and ready for the taking
Earth shattering, groundbreaking
Head scarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that
I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse
Is the only thing that doesn't come now
Well, what now?

Did somebody
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!

Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like guns n' roses
You got options but I been chosen
Deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it
Oh, you
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixing potion
Slashin' like guns n' roses
You got options but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeahHere we go
Yeah

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms that its not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like billy jean
But the kid is mine
Sandy used to tell me all it takes it one time
And all it took is one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times are nothing like the new times
Now it's rough times
I'm out here on front lines
Just making sure I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them
I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different
Cause I've been through it
But this is the hardest truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories
I tell you now
I don't want you worry about
Who's house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who for you before you got here
Now, look, I'm too pride to let
That come between you now
Realize I got a thing for two now
I better make it
I promise if I'm not there then I'm dedicated
This the first positive dna we ever celebrated
I can't forget the look on their faces
Got the news in miami
That we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell jello to bring some [?] rosé
And baka ride south to cheers
To the next generation
But the champagne toast is short lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time
Introduced you to saint nick
He must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother growing so fast
That they don't even fit
But you know
I still had to get it for my boy, you know
You haven't met your grandfather
That nigga a trip
He probably did stand up
But at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gonna be
When it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of coure
I got this 11 tatted for somebody
Now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get 100 more
Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover gorund
They said in two weeks
You're supposed to be in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of cutting each other down

God willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this
My g

No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to cry on
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain
To ease the pain
I'm changing from boy to a man[Nai Palm]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice
And more chune for your head tops
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Drake]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin' up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!

Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable? "
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef Kd

Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Voice on the phone]
Trying to think of the right thing to say[Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me

[Drake]
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on my road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah

[Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know, I know

[Drake]
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?Hello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me

You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to (yeah, yeah)
You need me to

You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but

You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to (yeah, oh-oh, yeah)
You need me to (yeah)
You need me to

Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

God knows it
Your mind impure, soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn they back
On they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back

Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried

I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn they back
On they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back
girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again

You're not here and we both know why
So, move from me

Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me I'll go crazy

Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to fall off to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex

I'm blem for real

You move with me I'll go-look

Don't switch on me, I got big plans

Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee
'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins
but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and a split put me right on my back

Virginia Black

Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish

You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (shing!)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cozy (greaze!)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (greaze!)
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade
Red umbrella when I make it rain
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same (greaze)
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans (yeah)

Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (straight)
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me (yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?
(Greaze!) Taliban, Halloween (icy)
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (greaze!)
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine (jheeze!)
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene

Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a habibis ting, ya?

Yeah, my side girl got a 5s
With the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away
Better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody
Which is ironic 'cause your next album
Probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like
"how is niggas really gettin' down? "
I could never have a kid
Then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around
Where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150, 000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas
Just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up
Then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty
Man, I'm tryna make it now

Gettin' loose, off the henny
'roc, and a hint of goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' dead prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my rollie, told my bitch
"let's go snorkelin'! "
Out in portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with jay
But I still send a tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and drake kick like kid n' play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free max b out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

Michael jordan with the tennis shoesPut her on the altar, tie her down secure
She will soon die, her soul is still pure
Her body is trembling it's filled with fear
She'll lose the life which she holds dear

The dagger is ready to do it's evil deed
On her decayed corpse I will feed
Tie her legs and arms ready to read the rite
Now I feel the force of satan's might

Under baphomet she is bleeding fast
With the corpse indulge in a bloodbath
Pray to the master that this will suffice
Split her skull for this altar sacrifice

Tears on her cheek, sweat on her brow
It's time to die I will kill her now
Death has come to deliver her fate
We don't do it for love we do it for hate[Intro: DJ Paul]
You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

[Chorus: Drake]
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that wayYour heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night
and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel
when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6am
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam
Jesus ChristÉ como diz
Se você ensina alguém
Não perde nada
Quem só vê o bem se o retorno é imediato
Tem que se cuidar pra que não fique sem
Porque a troca é necessária pra chama que se mantém
Viva como é o ciclo da vida
A folha vira adubo da árvore crescida
Quem queima etapas no processo é o chamado suicida
Cuja batida do coração é comprimida
A saída é fazer dos versos e princípios
Alimentos pros espíritos, ao físico o estímulo
Kemet o símbolo de novos tempos
Buscando lá nos templos de antigamente
A ídeia, a semente, gerando a si mesma tipo uma corrente
Nos atos e nas mentes
Infelizmente nem sempre está presente
Malcolm diz que nosso povo está doente
Fundamentos e atitudes
Exercitando a negritude
Bebendo dessa fonte como num açude
Por mais que o tempo mude
Eu nunca vou buscar raízes ou futuro lá em Hollywood

Kmt é o poder de quem ficou pra trás
Kmt carrega a força dos meus ancestrais
Representa a união de quem sofre demais
Todo dia um novo ciclo se refaz

Nossa defesa é tão forte os cara pensa que é ataque
Misturo tambor de guerra, berimbau e atabaque
Discurso de araque faz jus a sua reputação
Cair faz parte, aprendi muito com o chão
Ó que vacilão chamou gorila de macaco
Criticou o brilho e se tornou opaco
Caneta e microfone formação de quadrilha
Dois mil e hoje é o ano da partilha
Pra quem acha difícil definir pra dar cota
Pergunta quem são os preto pra rota
Sua inteligência esgota a minha paciência
Sua tese de mestrado é parte da minha vivencia
Agora eu sei, eu entendi o jogo
Nem todo fogo é acidente nem todo acidente é fogo
Louco, tô me jogando nos corres
E como dis Edy Rock, Olha quem mata e quem morre[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks
They're nothing anyway
They're no better than me
Out there you just have to fit into a pattern
that somebody's already laid out for you
Life we live
you have to set your own patterns
your own ideals
You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide
like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my Xo niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends
shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man
I'm still on the run
All these number ones
and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas
and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches
I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition, "
hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas
on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn
when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like
they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first
but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more
when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean
it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all
when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy
and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin'
and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin'
even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Outro: 600 Breezy]
This is the 6's year
Six hundreds instead of six, Ovo
You know we'll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I'm sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's the boy but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real-I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

[Chorus: Drake]
Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

[Chorus: Drake]
Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

[Verse 3: Drake]
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein'
cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like
"Are we straight? "
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned
about this negative tone
that I'm hearing in your voice these days
I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from
and you have reason to question your anxieties
and how disillusioned you feel
as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe
you can trust
But that attitude will just hold you back in this life
and you're going to continue to feel alienated
Give some thought to this
because I'm confident in you
and I know you can reach your
desired destination and accomplish your goals
much more
quickly without this confrontation
I'm hearing in your tone
these days. When others go low, we go highYeah, hey

Pool in my eyes, as you beg I testify that
I hate being alone, but you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping, oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like "dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to the old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already

Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are getting hot and heavy
Things are getting hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been going through it
Hoping everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way, back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next girl
I can't pretend

We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are getting hot and heavy
Things are getting hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you babe

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already

Six months since I've been back in the Six
I can't help but wonder how you've been babe

What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighing heavy on my mind and
I can't help but wonder how you've been babe

What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babeYeah, yeah

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face
I've been down so long
It look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was all in
No you can't son me
You won't never get to run me
Just know when I gotta reach out
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face
And it's just not the same

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face

Yeah, straight up to my face
Tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it like right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since then, things never been the same

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
(I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say
(I don't trust a word...)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(that's just what I heard)
Look you in the face
And it's just not the same

I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face
I've been down so long
It look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face

Skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at Silvercity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at Ovo, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone
callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40, 000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yout when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club Liv
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7am in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends
I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends
I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
that looked just like the Bently
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when its business with you its personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
now were meeting our ends

[Bridge]
And its all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side
that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee it where I belong
Out here in La I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And its all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went
and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My look is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there
must just love testing my patience
Someone up there
must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya
that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the wave
Same way I'm realized on a day to day

[Hook]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends
I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends
I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro]
Anytime people want to start problems
For real are you done
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no [?] heart man
And I'm not afraid of [?]
And I'm not afraid of no waste neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Its that factI should be downtown,
 Whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us
 To show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying
 To make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back
 In my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down
 On my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way,
 You think I deserve it

Feel a way, feel a way,
 Young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't
 Mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way,
 Young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have
 Just did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you
There's more than life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us
 To show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying
 To make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back
 In my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down
 On my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way,
 You think I deserve it

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way,
 Young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way,
 Young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say[Intro]
Why you live off of the hype bruh?
Real T-way!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could Gps you if you need some addressing
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they were bidding on me
But I'm young money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasing women a distraction
They want to be on Tv right next to me
You cannot be right next to me
Don't you see Riri next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get alone man, we tried
What's the point in trying
I had a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to doubt eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost my 50 at Tiffany's
Shoutout to Tiffany Stephanie
They used to always used to cheer with me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Hook: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money right now
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like June Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like Nasa
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
A gram, two poppin' [?]
A [?] the chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give your side of the story
They heard it, but they weren't hearing it
They feeling the way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to go, they got to go
They gotta doubt eventually
I cannot give them no empathy
I'mma have [?] when I'm at 70
They cannot fuck with my legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this there's no one trying me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Hook: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money right now
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done[Verse]
One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza
cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century
runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother
man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house
and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble
just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead
but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel
like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday
you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy
that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it
when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes
to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up
When my name is mentioned
Shout out to Kd we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget
about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you
to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat
just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me
started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique
T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to [?]
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm Tbe
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems
when it's sowed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to back peddle
Don't let your new found fame
fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You had to ride Ttc metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked
right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, jelly be talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things
to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women
that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
to say to you right now

[Verse 3]
Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe
that you're still drivin' with just me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim
you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind
when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say
to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down
they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here
shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since take care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

[Outro]
Yeah
I know] (9069799)[Intro: Pimp C, Drake Amber Rose]
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit
but not in a, not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
cause they feel like they know me
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game
This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money
you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?

[Hook: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 2: Drake]
You hit me like "I know you're there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze

[Hook: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 3: dvsn]
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Don't mean that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When were in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over[Verse 1: Drake]
Right, may I just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let them fall through
I, I, I, I, I

[Hook: Drake]
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci cry for You
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay, you like it
When I get, aggressive, tell you to
Go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Bridge: Drake]
And I'm never on a waste steady
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your love and
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree

[Hook: Drake]
Knowing I'd lie for you
Thinking I'd die for you
Jodeci cry for you
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Verse 3: Popcaan]
Betta [?] ya garments
And a [?] chick up in mi apartment, oh
Big gyal in [?]
Action speak louder than argument, well

[Verse 4: Drake]
But you can't just diss and come tell me sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story
Nah, It don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're working on it
And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a thing with me
But when it comes to you, you

[Hook: Drake]
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry for you"
Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla

[Bridge: Drake]
And I'm never on a wasting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your love and
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree
Jeez!

[Outro]
Music [?]
[?] wind up them [?]
This is the summer summer [?] alert
Drake from Canada, [?]
[?] murda![Intro: Kyla Wizkid]
Baby I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go Ot
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Hook: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers is taking a hold on me

[Bridge: Kyla Wizkid]
Baby I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me

Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But you don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard yo never claimed the hood
Hear the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
that they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin'
Yeah, Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lot of sides on the same side
Ovo a gold mine
But I'm going to go no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, Like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city going crazy
Top 5 no debating
Top 5, top 5, top 5
And the whole city rave me
And I'm back inside a matrix
And I said that we'd make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no metal-on-the-way shit
We'd really put some days in

[Interlude: Future]
Hey why you so excited? What happened

Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to Cvs for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna fall in love I know
I'm not someone you should trust I know
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

[Refrain 2: Ha-Sizzle]
She rode that dick like a soldier

[Outro]
Thank you, thank's Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired bossYeah, yeah

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)

Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum (they do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga a number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me, I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, aye
Mama doesn't have to call work now, aye
I decide when I start work now, aye
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, '09 all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)Oh, baby, yeah

Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know[Intro]
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you

[Verse 1]
Throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my psychic, I just wanna buy
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

[Chorus]
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 2]
Look, you know I'm a writer, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus]
You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say it's guaranteed
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on him
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

[Chorus]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Outro]
I give you my all
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, baby, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my all
I give you my voice
This song's for you[Intro: The Winans]
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
Ovo on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jd's connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know
that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me
than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple Xl
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, storming through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna [?] the movements
gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me eitherYou used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' over backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you
Gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
Ever since I left the city(Refrão)
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back

Watch a nigga backtrack

life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'ont know who we are

Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go

When I pull up on a nigga

Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one
Yeaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set
in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

(Refrão)
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back

Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out
We haven't talked in a while, we should roll
To see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go
You know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in, oh no no no

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure, man man
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

Spending shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone, so they'll never know
But I might tell you one day, you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry 'bout doing your hair
Or what you should wear, this not a video shoot, I don't care
Don't over prepare
Gotta remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way, but just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you, j-just be ready to goThat's what they doin' Cameron,
They actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.

Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go

Voicemail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible
Ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, nigga you already know
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said "The first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together

Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine Coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ay

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you

We're sorry, you have reached a number
That has been disconnected or is no longer in service

Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause my boys are gettin' right, man

After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear

I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault girl 'cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I’m lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spend your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house
That you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun girl, but I hope it was worth it
'Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it I’m not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae

But name another woman ain't no other woman
That should come for me when I’m lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonelyYeah, sound sound sound
Real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map

And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the g's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year

Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to jackson state
Or grambling

Young nick cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to clark, went to hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that

Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm
home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone

Stepping on a swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iphone 6
Fuck my nigga terry for a new blackberry

You can get buried for a ounce of katy perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to 
play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind

Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's b-roll bitchIt's over, yeah it's over yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone

Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right nowFuck me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

(Verso 1: Drake)
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

Fuck me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

(Verso 2: Drake)
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

fuck me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

(Verso 3: Drake)
These days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done doing everything we done
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?(Verso 1)
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this
for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet
you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

(Verso 2)
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me
when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy
that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately
really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials
you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time
we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glen Grove
who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the [?] and listen to Cappadonna
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine
they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
As hell below. I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoying yourself?
If we may we'd just like to close off
with something a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all
Are having the same fears
shedding similar tears
and of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something
some food for thought[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook] x2
I still been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations
I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine
and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay remniscin'
And makeup sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl
And you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin', schemin'
Plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons, serve you up
with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin' that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
This the shit I wanna go out toStarted from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now the whole team here, nigga

Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much
I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we...

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now the whole team here, nigga

No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend
Where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend
Where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
'Cause we...

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom
Now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation
And you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
Well, made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his wu-tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure

(ponte)
How you feel about, coming home with a
Nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right
Do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a. m
In dallas who you like, baby, who you like

(verso 1)
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position
To reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice

(refrão)
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten

Worst motherfucker never loved us
This fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions
Nigga' we don't know shit
Flex, nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at
You, and look at you
Ahh - I'm glad that they chose us
Command, it's a
Mission
Trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish

[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us

Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us, remember?
Motherfucker

Loved us
Worst behavior

[Verse 1]
Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us

Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done grown up
You know me, you know me
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money
when I come for the shit like O. D. B

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed
with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L. A
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a. m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time
I'm coming back on my worst behavior

Remember?
Remember?
Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
they used to never want to hear us
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
Remember?
Motherfucker
Remember?
Worst behaviorOoh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah-ha
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah-ha

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home, going home)[Verse 1]
Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit
and we still lack communication

How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every
Conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh the idea's funny
Oh the idea's funny
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for homerun every time

[Hook]
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect
With somethin' babe
Swangin'

[Verse 2]
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say "You can be whoever you want
even yourself"
Yeah, I show up
Knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny
Little
Pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

[Hook]
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect
With somethin' babe
Swangin'

[Verse 3]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that
Shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

[Outro]
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl[Verse 1]
I don't know why they been lying
but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look
like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist
and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring
To, who is this nigga you heard
About?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Someone just gave you the
Run-around
Niggas downplaying the money
but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

[Hook]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh
Well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said
"Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're
Talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real
I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's
All that we do"

[Verse 2]
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man
no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
it could all be so simple
Talking that shit with your back to me
just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album
I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

[Hook]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh
Well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said
"Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're

Been ready, it's real

[Outro: Birdman]
You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga, swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga

Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

If I ever leave you, darlin'
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
'Cause your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned, and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do

Much too much to bear

Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear[Intro]
We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

[Hook x2]
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

[Verse 2]
Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, 

they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing forreal
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you 
when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

[Hook]
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

[Outro]
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?
Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Who's bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, 
come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, 
come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonightHow I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you don't love me baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days its six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income

You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like seal nigga

Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga
Are these people discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't michael jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing shit you say through the grapevine

But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I aint even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

I know, I know that you don't love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time

And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy

Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever. you know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like mac dre in the bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way

The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with

Feel like I've been here before huh?
I still got 10 years to go huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right

I know, I know that you don't love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead bodyI can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it: Alisha, Catya
I know that you gon hear this: I'm the man
Yeah I said it! Bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now, that's me, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you

She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition

And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you..I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we
Drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin in and out of consciousness
And they sayin I'm bad, I agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit
I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And that they want to see me pick it back up
Well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Stuff my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gonna make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know

That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave em a chance to decide
Now, that's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yelling out money over everything
Money on my mind. Then she wanna ask
When it got so empty. Tell her I apologize
Happened over time. She said she miss the old Drake
Girl, don't tempt me..
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do

I'm like "why I gotta be all that?"
But still, I can't deny the fact
That it's true, listening to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin is about to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gonna hype me up and make me catch your body like that
Cause I live for this, this isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it
They know. They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know

That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys, and I even gave em
A chance to decide, now that's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yelling out: money over everything, money on my mind
Tell them I apologize, happened over time
They knowOoh, ooh
Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooh

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C-4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C-4
Twenty, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop close
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light skinned chick first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls first flight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew ooh

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say "your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story, it made history
Tell em I'ma need reservations for twenty
I never really been one for the preservation of money nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and XO is everything you believe in I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew ooh,
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew ooh,
'Cause we blowing like a C-4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C-4
If you broadcast swag, nigga we the news in the cityKnow you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say

Know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost[Woman on phone]
"Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
shit... wine or water
you should see someone about a cold drink
Idk I'm delirious... night"

[Verse 1]
Cups of the rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I been in this club too long
The woman that I would try,
is happy with a good guy,
But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

[Hook]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know that you still think about the times that we had
I say
Fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Woman on phone]
"Are you drunk right now?"

[Drake]
I'm just saying, you can do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying, you could do better
And I'll start hating? only if you make me

uh

[Verse 2]
Cups of that Xo
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning,
What you doing that's so important
I've been drinking so much that I'ma call you anyway and say

[Hook]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know that you still think about the times we had
I say
Fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Woman on Phone]
Are you drunk right now?

[Drake]
I'm just saying, you can do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just saying, you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me 

[Verse 3]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

[Drake and Woman on phone]
"Well I'm sorry"
"Are you drunk right now?" - Woman

[Drake]
I'm just saying, you can do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just saying, you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

[Drake on phone]
"You're not going to come?"
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then..."

[Bridge]
Just throw up while I hold your hurt back
Her white friends said you niggas crazy
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that.
Cause if they did we gon be in some trouble.[Intro]
If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I’d jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis

I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian

That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything 
That your palm write

Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience, 
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read

I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series

I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know

Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah

Felt like the initiation, 
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making

Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know

The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:

You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I diedBridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don’t do nothing, I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you

B-b-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guarding?
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you

I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you areAll we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!

It’s your worst nightmare, it’s my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don’t trust these hoes at all
But that’s just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I’m ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan my only role models
That’s why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing
I’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields they’re making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel
Drug money, outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team
Matchin’ Rollies for real, matchin’ Rovers for real
Places they say they’ve been, we’ve actually going for real
I’m really killin’ shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin’
I’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that’s living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they’d ever survive in this era
In a time where it’s recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin’ fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I’m hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy
Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I’m heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost the rate up, it’s time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin’ spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That’s why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

You know I love this
Yolo, "You Only Live Once"
I’m going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink
The hustle’s an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I’m talkin’ Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It’s the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every by week, shit, I’m bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickin’, lookin’ like a fallin’ star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' ye' like anime
I run the game but the ladies think I’m running game
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate
Rosay and Drake, I’m gettin’ cake, nothin’ short of great huh!When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho)[Verse 1]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

[Bridge]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last..
Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabiesIt’s like ’09 in your basement and I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should'a known
'Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib, you would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out, man
You deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help
In keeping me in this, in this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feelings about that
So God bless you, and I hope I'll see youAll my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

Aw Yeah[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good
All in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh[Produced by Francis and the Lights]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose[Intro]
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I, I, I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

[Verse 1]
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget?
My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

[Hook]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"

[Verse 2]
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

[Hook]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"

[Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over[Produced by Boi-1da and Al-Khaaliq]

[Intro]
Young Money

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over[Pre-Hook]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Hook]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

[Pre-Hook]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Hook]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Pre-Hook]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Hook]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Hook: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'mma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Hook: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj & Drake]
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww

[Hook: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team

[Verse 1: Drake]
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well, aren’t you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like "voilà!" You do it right he might just buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I’m buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Beamer
Champagne Range, Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big

Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (show time)
Go, go, go, go, go (as we proceed)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Ki-Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Hook: Drake & The-Dream]
And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice (they'd know) they'd notice (they'd know)
That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
Every time we come around, round, round
And they'd notice (they'd know) they'd notice
You shut it down

[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Hook: Drake & The-Dream]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
You shut it, ohh
And they'd notice, they'd notice

[Bridge: The-Dream]
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go go go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it[Intro]
Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven’t slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed
To go our separate ways, so I’m single
Thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just

[Hook: Young Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say "for life" y'all say "forever"
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life her name's the game

[Hook: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
(Let me know, let me know)[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you."
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probly true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
But I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park, stuntin' hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
And I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
That's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gonna tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

[Hook: Drake]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owwwls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowin', I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

[Hook: Drake]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go[Verse 1: Drake]
I said "Tell me what's really going on?"
"Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening?"
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake, you got 'em right?) Yeah, I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her—but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stands for "Do Right And Kill Everything"
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rolling
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowing
Cause it's on...

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ughhh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lying in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't tripping, I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zo?
Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for "front door"
Cause that's where I bring it, soo-woo if you banging, motherfucker

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa[Verse 1]
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know

[Hook]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Verse 2]
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Hook]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart, (hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Hook]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—

[Hook]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

[Hook]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

[Hook]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart[Hook]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

[Verse 1]
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up the scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

[Hook]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

[Verse 2]
Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

[Hook]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me nowDiplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy? "
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes
for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple
with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line
like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures
airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 Pm like, "Where does the day go? "
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin'
retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence
but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though
all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around
and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute
to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The Tv playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever
Ovo will always be together like Shakira

I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, IYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day
if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly
(No)
I'm goin' on them once I get going
(No-no)

She tryna take it all off for me

I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself
I need to take it easy
Easy, easy, easy

I can't say "No"
How you shine
You need a
Baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time
Just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please"
I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan

Yeah, you want a supermodel pose
like mi real friend Winnie
Yeah, vacation's done but I'm not finished, no

Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
Can't drink all day

I can't play myself
Oh, first night
Holy night
Five in the morning, yeah
And it feels like you're mine
Signs of the times
Oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times
I say all the time
Taking my time just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfectAlright, this is the last time I'm doing this shit with you
Yeah, let the people all know

Popeye wanna pop at the elegant (elegant)
Plus the little boy wanna play again (play again)

Devil with the flow, with the crucifix

Two birds, one stone (ye)
Two birds with the one stone (ye, ye)
Two birds, one stone
Two birds with the one stone (one stone)

Tell me how my dick ended up in your main chick
Threesome with the hoe, double trouble, don't ever say shit
Bouncing in the bed while they swallow up all my brain kids
Popeye in the opposite hearing them from my cockpit (damn)
Your music, fam, it's so lame (uh)
Rapping about a kitty, are you braindead? (haha)

Whispering "Joe" for haunted bullshit
Who the hell would wanna go buy your book of bullshit?
Filming all your dead tunes with Elliot
One week break? You're a legitimate idiot
Tweeting that you'll knock me out, just like Theo, huh?
Yeah, black-facing prick wanna be me, huh?
Yeah, begging to think that you're gon' beat me, huh?
Yeah, Popeye the prick, now regret it, huh

Two birds, one stone (uh, uh)
Two birds with the one stone (one stone)

Lying to your mama
Guess I gotta add some Kerosene to the drama (ay)
When she hears the whole of the verse, she's gonna jet (ay)
Especially when she hears me tell her that you're doing Ket, man
I don't wanna be that type of dude blurting all of your business
Know that you're the one that started this
The Lord is my witness
Guess he saw that time in Pascha when you paid for that BJ
Then the prozzy bruised your dick
Now you're scared of them BJs, hey
Now you're getting pegged
Got these little kids looking up the shit I said (damn)
You a bitch boy, I don't care if you're rich, boy
Degrading cause Ezekiel robbed your shit, boy
Nissan GTR with your coin money (coin money)
Snaking all of your boys just for more money (more money)
You're a dodgy prick, let that settle in (D-amn)
Blood-boiling bars, let that kettle sing (god-damn)
Your balls online, that's unsettling (Jesus!)
With the DM telling me, you're too pussy fighting me
'Cause you know you'll lose to me
Little boy is getting slapped up
You fucked up when you aimed at me (trip, trip)

Two birds with the one stone[Verse 1: Drake]
This is all God's doing, man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talking I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only 29, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
Facetime with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts
'cause she know that we at war, yeah

You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'

You gon' make me call my bros, for assistance
Make me call my bro

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Baby, I'm a savage I ain't romantic
When I come around these rappers, niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now
(Hatin' now)
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (Mansion)
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now (Blasting)

I don't need love, I'm the G. O. A. T
I just hit the beat and float
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smoking in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the Tl, now I'm cheese
I'mma turn this Tsx into a Benz soon
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon
150-inch screen in my bedroom

All summer sixteen

Playing dirty, not clean
Out in front of Four Season
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing

Looking for revenge
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus 20, we in Pitfield
That Kai's Kitchen in Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I'm still in the cut
When they round up the troops
I'm just a sicko, a real sicko
When you get to know me, nigga
I let the diss record drop
You was staying right below me, nigga
We must've played it a hundred times
You was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest I expect you to aim for the head?
I could've killed you the first time
You won't have to try to say it louder, nigga
Trust me, heard you the first time
It's nothing personal, I would've done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day one's
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys, they a handful
Then I hit them with a Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave boy with the dance moves
Jimmy Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can't pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
And fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house, nigga

All you boys in the new Toronto wanna be me a little
All you exes know I like my O's with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away and didn't say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang
You was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I'm better off anyway, y'all never gon' finish Drake
Say you seeing 'bout it when you see me, man
Y'all never home anyway
Thought of things that you should've said
Said things that you shouldn't say
We even gave y'all the whole money play
Y'all broke to this day
"Oh, it's your time now"
Yeah, that's what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA
Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye's pool is nice
Mine is just big is what I'm saying
I'm that nigga is what I'm saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I'm not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six
Soon as I'm back in the city, they throw a parade
I might get the key to city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys, to carry the wave
So trust me, they'll be out here looking for revenge
