[Intro]
Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts
and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like
I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening t-to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man
how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
(Fuck my side chick!)
You will never see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll just turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us? " (ooh-ooh)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy ‘zae
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck are you gonna do? Where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder
when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse
you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head
because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded
but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge
but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat
and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached, my enemies die
I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach! "
Shout to all my colorblind people
each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date, " "Looks like an olive to me. "
"Look, there's an apple! " "No it's not, it's a peach! "
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, [?]
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists. "
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
They can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleanersMotherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah), sayin' I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin' tell them make me (bitch), eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo), wanna be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who made it, it's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, even padded with automatic stay pray
Gat anything that may stay in their way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a tre eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan tasks cam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs
Ain't givin' ways ankle the ways you chumps don't
Even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someonea lump in their throat
If you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high
when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
then you better take it back to the shelter
And Hamburger Helper, 'cause damn it I'm still the—

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world
greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed
about the way I misprounouced a name
"DIE ANTWOORD! "
Fuck! I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs
to let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me
and I was just tryin' to give you a shout
Now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Ya'll fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful
with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not-gonna-ever
I'll never let up on the pedal might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wiping everyone up in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world
greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like I flunked suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped ISIS with a ISIS flag
bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that I'm finna hit back 'til I run out of gun powder
and split the scene
Hold the mic like similar to pistol squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the cig lit
like it's nicotine drinking, when slim gets mean
Bars on these boys when I split them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly
I'ma sting like a bee you ain't harming a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond
to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'cause I know one day I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world
greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest, woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatestWoah
Joyner, Joyner
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
I done did a lot of things in my day
I admit it, I don't take back what I say
If I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy
But I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga
Bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all
I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eating long enough
It's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate
Where my drink?
This my day
Lucky you
Fuck you too, woah!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Put my MAC on and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushing
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck what you rapping, you practically suckin'
You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some banging
Some chains and some blades in, and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothing but lies
Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch, I'm a dog call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just drop four like an Uno
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, liltle puto, and all of you culo
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto
lookin' for something that prolly can never find out
Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now
What you would nigga? You really want me tied down
I've been alone, I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty
I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm going out as the underdog
who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower

I have said a lotta things in my day
I admit it, this is payback in a way
I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker!
Bend the law
Fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all
Now I got too much to lose
I been eating long enough
Man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet
Lucky me
Fuck you think? (woo!)

I got a couple of mansions, still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
but to these kids it don't actually matter
They're asking me "What the fuck happened to hip-hop? "
I said "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat of uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say "what a wonderful feeling"
We're on the upswing
like we're punching the ceiling
But nothing is stealing, like anyone has any fucking ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killing me
the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata
"Why don't we make a bunch of fuckin' songs about nothin'
And mumble", and fuck it
I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps
it's recap
Way back, MC's that
Recap, and tape decks
Eight DATs with the G raps and
Kane's at, we need three stacks
ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats
syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad but in fact
With a old-me at the same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They all got button to press
or a lever to pull
It gives me the snap though (little bitch)
And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big
But you've been taking the dicks
On the fuckin' gag, hoe (get it?)
On the brink in a minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'ma sleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinking about an evil intent
Of another beat 'em and kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300mg
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up being a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker never got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, aye
It's the moment y'all been waiting for
Like California wishin' rain'd pour
And that drought y'all have been praying for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a writer might've fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move (yeah)
y'all gotta move (yeah)
y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
give me the juiceYo, how do I keep (I don't know what's up with these hoes)
Getting in relationships like this (I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not till she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean
And now she starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
in her evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zoning to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you
she don't know that she's the first thing
I think of when I wake up
and the last thing I think of before I go to sleep
Sike
Hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats
I know that she's heartless

She's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger

She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep a hun
We all but kicked her out
called her back now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
I picked someone that's so unlock-able and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids
But I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringing up that one time she
Tried to two time me
And throw it up in her face till I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree you fucking bitch
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me flip little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita
Fajita slut treat just like a drum
Beat it, complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fucking die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hoppin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
and then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?
Yeah, I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?[Skit: Eminem & GPS]
Paul, yo, um
So I got your message
I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um
Turn right
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody
who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like, what people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo mother fucker, whatever the fuck his name is, said I, literally said I rhymed "rhymes" with "chimes"
"Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes"
Turn right
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
Turn left
I'll hit you back laterIts 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge
Watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it
Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce
for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof wrote, souped
and soaked in our youth
Thought we was running shit
till we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was going through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hoping they do
So I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position
so that they knew how to stand on they own
and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died
so did the group

If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in
been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did
More than try talking you into coming up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we would've politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washing my sins in it
til my conscious is clear

If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Bacardi in hand
Never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit
but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift
All the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get?
For turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift
A Freudian slip
Subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words

But I guess there just are none for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here
But that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to
But I'm fighting for air
I'm barely charting myself
Feels like I'm under the sink

But it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road
Done all we possibly can
I know we kept up our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stonesTay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Yeah

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to
feeling like the streets need me (woah)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spyder move
like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati
white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out
how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out
how to do Capri styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints
probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel
now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all in the stuff
like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them
uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
When the cops set us up, we can flush the shit down
We can no give a fuck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in prince pants
You niggers—

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ayy)
The people you run with are thuggin' (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged
in connection with battery
bitch, you ain't plugged in nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better pull up
Strap on, in other words if you're a Gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a Arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
His tough demeanor, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
if you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you
but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfucker, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories
jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, rarely but this time Shady
'bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer
on this little non-threatening blond fairy
cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach
letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R. I. P. Prodigy
Soldier in my soul
and I told them the moment he signed me
that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch
it's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein
a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is groper, I roleplay with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives
I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Rolex to gold in and I'm [?] tryna throw in [?]
They both hate to choke and my hoe play the [?]
And I double-edge sworded
'cause one place I poke and I stick and I turn
and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick
a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formiddable, that you're bitches
are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common
is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nuttin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One month older
Sponge, mob, colder
None, rug, hoaster
Lug, nut, coaster
Lung, jug roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic
(Man, fuck this shit; let's go)Okay, how do I say this? (fack, fack, fack)
Last year didn't work out so well for me
(fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, welp (fack, fack)

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear
the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome
stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart
you didn't write like you wrote it
While I T-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives
that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents
and I am the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned on rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up
any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45
that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass
it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair with [the Bernanke one stale?]
beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serial killin' every beat there is, it [?]

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin', somethin' evil is lurkin'
I'm no conspiracy theorist but somethin' here is afoot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurement stick (what?)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular
since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects
'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views
you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shootYou're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home right
Right, sike

Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man

I hop in your whip and take a sip then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cumin'
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes
but females be Rushin' me outside my tele
temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint
they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home right
Right, sike

Suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man

I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael [?]
You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La proxima yo se que mejor me quedo sola
Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola
I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
I need scope 'cause my breath stinks
You hope that I choke on a Pepsi
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit
no skin tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling
like a slingshot
You say "don't come over" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing
Why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing byHere we go again
From heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo
But we both were jilted
A couple of times
So we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together
A severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh
Just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk
Now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for
sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?
Another late night in
She stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys
sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for
When you date my friends
in order to wipe your ass
When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the date I can hear you say
"Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like wind
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true
Just to scream "Fuck you! "
Guess you take life in the same way
you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me
and roll them little snake eyes in
Since

Since you bought the jury
They'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury
They'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater
Convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater
Convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
They like, "You're the good guy. "
They like, they like, they like

But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow
so I scrap these, As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the- it's the curse of the-)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy
Love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage! "
God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B. I. G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's-a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your
Your expectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls
eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it
Now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind
I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground up
Like round chuck, and still 
put hands on you
Staying wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes
I just got the air about me
Like wind chimes (yeah)
Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated
And I made it, and my neighbors say hi 
(say hi)
I'm giving them pounds, 
I'm upscale now
Guess it means 
I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days of,
minimal wage for

General labor,
welfare recipients is a minor
Look at how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first
you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use 
'cause being broke's a poor excuse
That shit only gives you more fuel
Show them why you're you
So close, God,
it's like I almost got it
But close only counts 
in timebombs and horseshoes
So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick)

No remorse
Screw it, I'm lit, 
and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with 
a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done, 
nah, bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, 
got my faith,
 where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I get everything I had 
to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you 
turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will 
never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) 
Do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes these
thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me, they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots,
and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead-ed birth, 
you just forehead on Earth
Too short for a verse, studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America

Stick a fork in it and turn
'Cause four-letter words 
are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
You're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consoling you 
when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
so people are always looking at me
as they're going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear, 
shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleaning Out My Closet" 
when I was having trouble 
with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up, 
like you're trying 
to fix a flat (uh), 
when you struggle with despair
That double fisted bear, 
knuckles coupled with this 
pair of nuts I'm cupping
I am your fucking switch, nothing can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I get everything 
I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you 
turn your back on me
Now and walk out 
I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) 
Do you still believe in me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your
corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low
I'm gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof 
on my back
I called you Proof 'cause I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole
Homie I'm calling on you 
'cause I think I'm slowly 
startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and motivation to go
Hussein with the flow
Fake fans with the two-faced that show
Let heartbeats loot, 
produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement, 
hate to go down this road
But there's only one route 
to cross this bridge
So I walk in this 
bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But it's never too late 
to start a new beginning
That goes for you too

So what the fuck you gon' do,
use the tools you're given?
Or are you going to use
the cards you were dealt
as an excuse for you to not 
do shit with them
I used to play the loser victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and
I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks,
turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, 
I'd still have none to waste

Man, in my younger days,
that dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I run in place 
while this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace 
and the hunger pains once 
you've won the race?
When that pool exhaust is cooling off
'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove 
at all
'Cause you done already 
hit them with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with 
that Bruce Willis
That blue still, that truth still
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
To the English language
With this ink
You haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad
It's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm
Gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul
That's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher
Electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air
I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep
I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit
Next shit
I'm at your throat
I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose
What can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose
Destruction is loose
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh
And still conjoined at the hip with hop
still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah)
Like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill
And some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick
And blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent
She's a Milf when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins
Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views
In common with you
Just not Youtube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep
I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit
Next shit
I'm at your throat
I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a Tec-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex
I Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my
Colombian necktie
Prostitute
just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her
Cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey
As Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean
To Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm trutv
You're too Pg
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap
And I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep
I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit
Next shit
I'm at your throat
I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you
Hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose
What can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose
Destruction is loose
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chewHands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talked to like, you're just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it, they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a Derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach Congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to buildI've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched
To catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back
Like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick
And she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said "Bye Susan"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand
Turned in two-night stand
He was calling so might scram
Now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt
But what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you
Like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
Denver (ooh), watch the river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey! "
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe
That's why I made they came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
Well, I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie
To tell a unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one (I'm sorry), I don't wanna admit to something
(I fucked up) If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now, are falling like the rain
So let the river runYeah
Damn girl
Do I drive you crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things, I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things, that I never felt
You gotta be the real thing 'cause you remind me of myselfI bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals, get on the floor
When I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Bodies bananas and sass to go wit'
I spot you at first glance and go, "shit"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinking soon as trampolines so we should bounce
But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinking that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smoking like Snoop Dogg
But you must be Token if you think you're taking over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this brouha to a barroom brawl
So hit scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

Said can I take you home, where we can be alone
Shawty, you the shit
Girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feeling me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
From the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides ya fire (I love)
Like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl, you're so fucking fly
You belong in the mile high club
So come on baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm highstrung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim, and fire
Yes babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda
Why I love

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revivalYeah
Shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, 
so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and
heroism meets, square up in the streets
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch 
Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think banned 
transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's trying to divide us, 
this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny, he'll only unite us
'Cuz nothing drives us inside 
like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 
'cause our spirits are crushed
This spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life 
come to pull us from the wreckage
That's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes 
'cause this type of pickle 
we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch 
like a scab for scars to heal
And band together for Charolettesville
And for Heather fallen heroes
Fill his wall with murals, Nevada get up
Hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero
This is our renewal, spray tan get ride of
Get a brand new, better, America
And here's to where we're from

This is where it all began, all began 
(stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am 
(hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place 
that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the klan,
'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter,
way to get your hate off, Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got a race card 
biggot, the swastika 
with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 
cause it's all you played off
And you just took the plate off,
so I guess it pays 
to feed off of chaos
So basically, you Adolf Hitler
But you ain't ruining our country, punk
You won't take our pride from us
You won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary,
 things are looking up
So much, got a sprained neck
Know we would rise up
Against this train wreck 
and take a stand
Even if it mean sitting 
when they raise the flag
This ain't the Star Spangled Banner
This man just praised 
a statue of General Lee, 'cause
He generally hates the black people, 
degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I would have spit on it 
before I went to shake his hand at the event
Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna 
try to tear apart a sacred land
We cherish and stand for, so
Hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him, and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from

This is where it all began, 
all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home,
that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home,
that so many died for
You already know there's no place like home,
no place like home
Wherever I go,
no place like home
No place like home, 
no place like home
Wherever I go

This is where it all began, all began
(stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like homeWe never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run
Back to the booth, jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue lashing then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny, back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once, and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls, your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband?

You were the beat I love, with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I wasn't sitting here asking myself

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that was what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve all I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused got a few, and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was, partly yours, partly mine
But really no one's, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over, and it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know
How some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husbandI'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my Dna
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell
I'm falling helplessly, I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit, every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, but definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven, but makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along, and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me, my friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness, I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she
Gets going, she don't stop, when I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say "screw her"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light now, I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endingsFeeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's 
"Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into 
where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking 
but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details 
or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because 
your Dna'll be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her Tv blares, 
can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, 
she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said: "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up, put her body parts 
in front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? 
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, 
Musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 
'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, 
there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump 
in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 
'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible 
for the dumb little blonde girl
That motherfuckin' baton twirler 
that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, 
Destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular 
then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler 
Discovered this winter, probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow 
since the month of November, oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches 
probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? 
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside Mcdonald's, Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, 
lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? 
The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For r'aping eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen, 
I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient 
while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes 
That when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: 
"I'm in your window"
But it never occurred to me 
I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see

[Chorus]
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? 
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

[verse 1: eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat
Sympathy pains for this track
This road is taking me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd
Be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had wembley stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed
To nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff grows
Half of madison square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that doesn't scare us
We pass no one, we're failures
'cause we're just

[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

[chorus: kehlani]
'cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast

[verse 2: eminem]
Fuck doing what you're told
Act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways
For mc's it's a funeral
When I'm devising this rhyme
'cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts provide oh nuts
And plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must have got you in somewhat of a debacle
'cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothing all though
There's a lot of shit I said
In jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart
It seems like it's in the wrong place
It's probably cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu reeves speed of life
Avoid or veer or just steer toward it
We're only looking forward but
Where we're going, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical
It's getting warm in here
I set the world on fire
Was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine but you've forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault is torture
It's more severe
Go to war with me or end up blew to timbuktu
I send at you a ten ton nuke like kim jong-un
And end up blewn in your career (north korea?)
All in all, it's said and done
And at the end of my run, I just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off, that day'll never come
To the pine box, bitch fuck you
I'm better than I ever was
'til the bomb drops, hope it never does but
I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause this
World's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top
So everyone's just

[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

[chorus: kehlani]
'cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast

[bridge: eminem]
You can't tell us nothing
Hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
And more tomorrow's we're done
And all we are is

[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

[chorus: kehlani]
'cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fastWanna take it from the top?

Lady, you remind me of my raps
on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick
as them accents
Two asscheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, 
it's massive
From the first time I saw you, 
I actually said to myself
"I gotta meet her like a taxi"
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic, 
but I'm stiff 
as a statue
You sat on a shelf, 
I feel like I'm a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, 
slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump 
your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you 
in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (meow!)
hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree 
on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'mma keep it a hundred,
 like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the 
dude following back
About six cars back, I'm in the 'lac
And I want to (uh)

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running-

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the
convenience store
But them jeans you wore,
like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there,
while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk,
while he rings you up
Pull up behind you,
when you're leaving
And you don't even know it 
(ayo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair, 
adjusting her mirror
She's rapping my shit, 
but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was
 and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air
It's something to see
But just like a girl 
who thinks her coochie doesn't stink
If she ain't planning to do 
shit, this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit
"Ain't stepping to you bitch,"
I say to myself
Plus she's bumping my music,
ain't chasing no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her, to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male,
let her come to me
Let her come to me, 
male sweater, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her
What is a [?]
Asked if she wants a computer 
lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple
She said, "put it inside her"
I said-

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running-

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Black out, come to, hands
covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shovel
stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat,
so that hoe must've been dug
'Cause it just died like "ooh,
food coloring, duh!"
So let's get turnt, like a
shish kebab, twist it, Ma
Like an air-conditioning knob
We be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better
late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot 
enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water,
I bet you get your self esteem
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl,
your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to
put the mother chumps on the back burner
You got buns,
I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head in
between that set of Ds
While I shred Mcs 
like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred 
in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so, too, 
look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so 
I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl,
I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one, 
to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running-

Feel, feel, feel, feel,
feel, my heat


On the ones and twos, threes 
and four in (the morning)
Rick's in the cut like Neosporin (what?)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
Who the fuck? It's my big dick
So everybody get ready right-fucking-nowYou claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like "oh my God he's trippin'"
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—shit's on, bruh! (haha)
Let me sing this shit soprano while I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects so I'm batting cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (haha)
Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (umm), so's my manager
Bitch, I am mature, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me 'cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives are butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into kaput ya
When I pull 'em like (what?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a ten, you’re an eight
Like what I do before, after and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap and try to
Get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh-huh, I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turdsIn your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin' your head up high
When you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine so I'm
Pickin' them up and stuffin' them back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Isn't it though amazing, back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it, did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I ever seen
And back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, ohBillions of years ago, sudden I was there
Placed on a rock, around it a lake, the borders that far
In the middle of the waste, it rose to the sky
The place was warmed by a young, yellow burning star
But why???
It had no enemies, until our tribe appeared
They filled the waste with science, soon it all was fertilized!
They filled the waste with the victims of human greed!!!
Huge, black walls surround the place; the last defence
Massive towers, with magic aura, grabbing for the sun
Winged guardians on the walls, armed with sorcery
The Arch-mage and his son prepared a medusa-stun

Mustard-seeds growing on the walls
Soon they tumble and they fall
The guardians fought at Thermopylae
Choosing Hades as the only way

Impale them with your lust!
Stun them with your greed!!!

Soon they all, they tumbled their fall
They fell, bleeding, into an endless night
The Virgin was raped, but no one helped her at all
The Arch-mage, he wept, his Son was crucified!

The Arch-mage scorched the Earth with his magic breath
After that he drowned us all, with his endless tears
Forty days of bitter sorrow brought the tribe to death
Very few survived it all, haunted by their fears

Man was scattered over Earth
Lost in too many different languagesIf I could rewind time like a tape,
inside a boombox
One day for every pill, or percocet that I ate
Cut down on the valium, that'll hurt everything
But death is turning so definite, wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, being, didn't want you to
know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged 
like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver 
and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, 
I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, 
just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, 
I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate 
when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to 
open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em, dad 
ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, 
I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, 
I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, 
I scream, but it's not allowed
You put your arm around mama, the karma, wow
I just thought about the aisle, 
I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do, and Proof, I'm truly sorry
If I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like 
new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you 
were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give 
anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and 
constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and 
I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on the table
Me falling across your body, 
not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, 
but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take 
care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always 
cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause 
she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those 
sacred vows, just know that if I could be there
I would and should you ever see 
parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, 
thank my father too
I actually learnt a lot from you, 
you taught me what not to do
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart
 honest and open talk to you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my 
body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut 
the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, 
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, 
so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly, I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape, find an escape
Make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find
My inner strength, to remind me
Even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

(I don't want it)
I'll put out this last album, 
then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, 
but just know
That I'm a good person, though 
they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this 
methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, 
closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back, I'm 'bout to, 
like a rematch
Outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers Lp2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward them and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'd have sang to my daughters
If I'd have made it to the hospital
Less than two hours later, but I fought it
Came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawning, I'm up, 
Tuesday, it's morning
Now I knowI walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, "this shit is garbage"
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a God, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)
But only when it freezes (It's true)

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the "Speedom" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary 
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out (write it out)
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh (haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (bitch!)

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chewI've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit (Fuck!)

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river runYo, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
He's tryin' to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (yeah)

Here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like homeWe never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I’m confused
Because

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got, thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn’t mean
The words that we meant that we didn’t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin’ still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husbandI'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I’m the one thing, you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don’t want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "Screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, symphony pains for this track
This road is taking me back, down memory lane with this rap
I could still look out in this crowd, be wild and be takin' aback 
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere, and fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff
Blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish, in the blast but that isn't scaring us
We pass knowing we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doing what you're told, act like a two year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom, and blow anyways
For MC's, it's a funeral
But I'm devising this rhyme, 'cause I am awake in your mourning
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts bravado, nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must've got you in somewhat of a debacle
Plus some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothing, although
There's a lot off shit I said in jest, that's though to swallow
But if at times, my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves, speed of light, avoid it, veer or just steer towards it
We're only looking forward, but where we're going
We have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical 
It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire
I was born to be an arsonist, just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine, but you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault this torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blue to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten tonne nuke like Kim Jung Un
And end up ruining your career
Moving on, this is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
To the pine box, bitch fuck you!
I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But, I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothing, hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young
(On the ride of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fastYou're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile, as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire 'cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin' to make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die ever should I
Leave you for good so never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm (startin' to think that maybe you need me)

Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need meYeah
Shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, 
so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and
heroism meets, square up in the streets
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch 
Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think banned 
transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's trying to divide us, 
this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny, he'll only unite us
'Cuz nothing drives us inside 
like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 
'cause our spirits are crushed
This spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life 
come to pull us from the wreckage
That's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes 
'cause this type of pickle 
we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch 
like a scab for scars to heal
And band together for Charolettesville
And for Heather fallen heroes
Fill his wall with murals, Nevada get up
Hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero
This is our renewal, spray tan get ride of
Get a brand new, better, America
And here's to where we're from

This is where it all began, all began 
(stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am 
(hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place 
that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the klan,
'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter,
way to get your hate off, Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got a race card 
biggot, the swastika 
with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 
cause it's all you played off
And you just took the plate off,
so I guess it pays 
to feed off of chaos
So basically, you Adolf Hitler
But you ain't ruining our country, punk
You won't take our pride from us
You won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary,
 things are looking up
So much, got a sprained neck
Know we would rise up
Against this train wreck 
and take a stand
Even if it mean sitting 
when they raise the flag
This ain't the Star Spangled Banner
This man just praised 
a statue of General Lee, 'cause
He generally hates the black people, 
degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I would have spit on it 
before I went to shake his hand at the event
Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna 
try to tear apart a sacred land
We cherish and stand for, so
Hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him, and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from

This is where it all began, 
all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home,
that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home,
that so many died for
You already know there's no place like home,
no place like home
Wherever I go,
no place like home
No place like home, 
no place like home
Wherever I go

This is where it all began, all began
(stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like homeIt's like I'm in this dirt diggin' up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio yer, right back on it
Remindin' me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm comin' for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me just
When I may have needed you most, oh, you thought it was over
You could just close the chapter 
And go about your life like it was nothin'
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well I've never recovered, but tonight 'betcha that whatch yer
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a, better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind is sayin' "let it go fuck this"
Heart is sayin' "I will once I bury this bitch alive hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset" and...

I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting' away with it?
Not this time you, better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, knit wit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed?
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten 
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
 That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to git 'cha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Puff, then I'm gone

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy

I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers Lp
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by m and m
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Oh, God, police! Ah!)
Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and frank ocean, oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, with the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off(Don't kill me)

Thank you!

Go, go, go (what the, f***?)
What the f*** are you doing?
Mothaf***er bail on me? F*** you!

Aw, you gotta be f***ing kidding me
Are you f***ing kidding me?
S***!
Get off

(Haha)

The parking lot
S***, ah!
(Let me see your hands, prank's over)
F*** it!(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one

My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Pica**o painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, don't care, don't have two s***s to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(Whats your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don’t know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha-ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

No! If he had, he wouldn’t have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn’t be so mad, my attitude wouldn’t be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm The epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, To be rapping
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I’m in the style department
With a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent, and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on, a
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea
Guilty, cause I sparked a, Revolution
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, b****
Cause its the…

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don’t give a f***, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

So yeah dad let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of like
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their f***ing parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their f***ing hair again
It's a stare ruckle, I chuckle
Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads
The sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold c***ed
You critics come pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your gla** house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my pa**ion til I'm pa**ed out
A completely brain dead Rainman
Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
So b****, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef
Cause I hate every f***ing thing, yeah
Even this rhyme b****, and quit tryna look
For a f***ing reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a criminal
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing is
Dad, I'm back at it again
B****[verse 1]
Pick up the god dang phone
Bitch where the fuck were you tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do screw dre?
You went there looking for me
Oo that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up
With a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew drake
Que lupe? you want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"ok yeeah, I'm cuckoo, hey? " well, screw you
And I'd be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? dre, drake, lupe? oh touche
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one
True blueace but you ain't
And I can see you and you make
That little boo-boo face
Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke
Blue kool aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[hook]
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3

[verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone
And just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk
Cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck ho's
But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias?
I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger
Through every single station it's on
Cause a woman broke my he-art
I say he-art cause you ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the l-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian *shout*
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just

[hook]
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3

[bridge]
Cuz you told me, you love me, forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never, wanted someone, to die
So bad in my fucking life but fuck it
There's other fish in the sea

[verse 3]
And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night
Bitch on a scale of 1 to 10, shit
I must be the holy grail of catches
Ho, I got an oscar attached to my fucking name (great)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor made for me
Say fuck it kick some shots back
Get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but they're failing
To latch onto the tail of my bumper
To scratch them with the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul
But my dick's on strike so all that love shit is null and void
Bitch I'm a droid, I void cupid stupid
Wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed
Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boys
Getting sick of these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink you fucking pigs
All you good boys doink doink doink
I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take em all out I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack
And just drop dead and I'mma throw a fucking party
After this cause

[hook]
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3

[outro]
I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you(Yeah) This is survival of the fittest
This, is, do or die
This, is, the winner takes it all, so take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill, though, the skill was there
In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin' raps and standin' for somethin'
Fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up on me
Afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
Raise your hands up like it's 12 noon
Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wait until you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough,
Came to ruffle feathers nah, egos, I ain't deflatin' 'em
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

This, is, survival of the fittest
This, is, do or die
This, is, the winner takes it all so take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter
I can adjust, plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this motherfucker and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck
I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
In the side of a pump
0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin' 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh might a been stuck
Bitch I'm bowing out I ain't taking a bounce
Stabbing myself with a fucking knife in the gut
While I'm whipping my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and like getting cut
I get excited, inside of my blood you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight until I die or win, bottom to gutts
It'll just get me angrier, wait let me just remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin' now draw a circle around it and ? to it slut

This, is, survival of the fittest
This, is, do or die
This, is, the winner takes it all so take it all, so take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Lift, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, the fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue
I'm showin' you the flow no one used
I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other traits
So you'd better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It’ll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I want you to believe
'Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self esteem must be fuckin' shooting through the roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you!
I must be allergic to failure cause every time I come close to it I just sneeze
But I just go achoo then achieve!

This, is, survival of the fittest
This, is, do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all, so take it allHook
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, don't matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I belong in this world
That's why scoffering authority, defined often
Flying off [...] to handle it with mom, no dad
So I'm non complying at home, at school
I'm just shy and awkward
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up joints on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
Because he said I eyeballed him

[Bridge]
And if you fall, ill get you there
I'll be your savior from all the words
that are inside your world
Please have faith in my words

Because... this is my legacy, legacy, ehh
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me looking
This is my legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid would always think
the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired Am I

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid would always think
the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Nogging?
Cuz' sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
Cuz I obsess on everything and my mind it's small shit
Bothers me but now my father he said cyanoira
and split but I don't give a shit. I'm fine along
as theirs batteries in my Walkman
nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which
I've acquired parts I found in the garbage
a frame and put tires on it, headphones
on straight ahead and gives a *** shit, but if this

Try and put up a fight's nonsense, but i think
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
Instead of tryina escape through my comics, why don't I
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is worth to fightCame to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking 
"If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls 
Like this I would kill him."

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit 
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
‘Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole!
Thanks for the support, asshole!

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but Goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a Goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo! My soul's escapin'
Through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door, retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch!
How do fuckin' magnets work?"
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind
Like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time, it ain't never gonna stop
A pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
So now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m going back to what got me here, yeah, cocky
And can’t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knowsNow this shit's about to kick off
This party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad
cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale
Well that's my pigment
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy
Since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk)
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
Cause it's mayhem 'til the a. m
So baby make just like K-Fed
and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berserk)
Shake your body

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging
Jump me in, bang, bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough
To feel stupid
Hope so, now ho

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk)
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
Cause it's mayhem 'til the a. m
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berserk)
Get your vials

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard
Thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine
To knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone
Car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered
Came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's
Girl you're fixin'
To get your heart broke
Don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby
Since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard
But don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk)
All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
Cause it's mayhem 'til the a. m
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berserk)
Get your vials

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
Cause it's mayhem 'til the a. m
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berserk)
Get your vialsLook, I was gonna go easy on you
And not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms
Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot
So call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer
Must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an Mc still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac
Pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts
While I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was under Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms
Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining
This shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key
And the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage
And youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since
Mc's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2pac N
W. A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy
Thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run Dmc and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it
With a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering
Take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday
Looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track
Call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park
The White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton
No Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately
With these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head
A zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
And pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try
And help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case
'Cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me
Like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big
And here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on "I'm Back"
From the Marshall Mathers Lp
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an Ak-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was
But I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like
When Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24 7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed
(Jj Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa
You assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you
I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying
Ricocheting off of me
And it'll glue to you
I'm never stating
More than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience
A feeling like it's levitating
Never fading
And I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off
They'd be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do
When they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses
Diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you're half as nice at songs
You can sacrifice virgins too
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do
What I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still "Chunky, But Funky"
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils
Here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate
Some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration
The bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient
And more symphatetic to the situation
And understand the discrimation
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck
Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?[Intro]

"Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain

Society would reap a great benefit."

[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this
situation I guess
Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head
Momma always said

[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
 A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said, 
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished, they've stomped me into the mud, 
gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you
beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
Cause you're doomed from the start
it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talkin'
In a trance locked in my room, yeah
but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, 
I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
threw my first punch - end of story
Still in my skull is a vacant empty void,
been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory
In this gourd there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, 
an orange, an extension cord, and a Ninja sword, not to mention 
four linchpins an astringent stored
Ironing board, a bench, a wrench an oru winch 
an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain like an 
independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, cause Momma always said

[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
 A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said, 
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Bridge]
Now my Mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top

[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America,
hear 'em yell out in terror they were so scared and those kids
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out of my smart
aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Mothafucking difficult, ch-yeah, 'til then, hopefully ya
Little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, 
tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You mothafuckin' (insert insult here)
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic in gridlock, shit hopping like six blocks
From a Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-
-Tober, and God forbid I see a wizard 
and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all, cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said

[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
 A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said, 
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Outro]
Insaneness ain't even a word, you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
nothing without you and I believe
I'm striving the roads,
I guess I can't breathe
just lay here with me, baby,
hold me please

And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I scream, baby, please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me
if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm about 
to jump off the edge

[Hook]
But you won't break me
You just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you 
I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I get back up and aah
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you had
Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
But you're all that I love
I guess you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I scream, baby, please don't leave
Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover 
that dream was dead

[Hook]
But you won't break me
You just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you 
I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I get back up and aah
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused
cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than not you by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried

Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
You were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
Felt like my whole relationship 
with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride 
or die?
cause if you could've took my life 
you would've

It's like you put a knife to my chest
and pushed it right through to the
other side of my pack, stuck a spike, 
you should've 
put up more of a fight, but I couldn't 
at the time no one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer

Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, 
finally showed a sign of life for me for the

First time since you left me and left me
with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we could've had and we 
could've been

But I'm breaking out of this lump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dump once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party

But you're never gonna beat me 
to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
would've been our anniversary

Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call
but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, 
so I put them in a verse to lay
And I thank you
cause you made me a better person than I was

But I hate you cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Hook]
But you won't break me
You just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you 
I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I get back up and aah
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Cause I'm stronger than I wasI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gas kit just blew

[Verse 1]
This always happens, 30 minutes from home
Gotta lay a long cable
and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall dropping a football
So every time someone walks in the john like at Madden
''Shady, what up? ''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping
And you're asking me for my godamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up [?] back and
Told him ''Todd, you're the shit''
when does all of this crap end?
Can't park my [?] without causing an accident
Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
But the [?] is my stomach as
I mix my corn with my fucking mash
Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bucking ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is up with glass?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
(Life's been good to me so far)

[Verse 2]
They call me [?], I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag
Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I live on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dad
Her eyeliners ran, her skirt snag
And I heard she drag-races, burp* swag
Fucking my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag
We'd be the perfect match
Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be and expert at computers?
I'd rather be an encyclopedia [?] Playstation
I'm still on my first manual from Zelda
Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with [?] and belts
They say it's [?], but it's bad for my health
But I think there's more white trash from the trailer
[?] welfare mentality helps to keep me grounded
that's why I never take full advantage of wealth
I Managed to dwell within these perimeters
still cramming the shells full of hamburger helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to
[?] a habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves
Got dammit to hell
I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell the
Other day someone got little elaborate
and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me

[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
(Life's been good to me so far)

[Bridge]
Got friends on facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

[Verse 3]
Trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me
[?] got punched over, giant nosebleed
As I mosey over to the frozen isle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did [?] America with Hova
Show's over, I'm hiding in [?] buying groceries
He had front row seats, told me to sign this poster
Then insults me ''wow, up close
didn't know you had gross feet''
Still shopping at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles
Got caught picking my nose, ah
Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still stuck up in one of my nostrils
Right next to him stuck at the light
This fucking shit is taking forever to change
I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in
Couldn't do nothing, play it off
''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better''
fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up
with another one after Recovery
So highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery
if I fumble it?
Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get to quit
On you sons of bitches

Quit snapping pictures of my fucking kids
I love my [?], but you push me to my limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out
Bitch, I got an elevator in my house
[?] I'm living the dream

[Hook]Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo"
‘Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, "No (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)
I (slurp) don't (slurp) do (slurp) this for anyone, ever"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me
Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me
You cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the…

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like
"Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checking into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of, (*Message sound*)
"Wait, dinner at eight?"
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of

Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-loveMom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm f***ed up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean s*** to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little p****) just leave)
Ma, let me grab my f***ing coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he f***ed us both
We're in the same f***ing boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that s***'s painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was where the f*** my deadbeat dad was
F*** it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your a**'s
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die

Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life[intro]
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think... I think the lines are starting to get blurry

[verse 1]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like mase when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace
I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger
And thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey
And started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake kanye's, jay's, wayne's
And the drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'sync
Now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battles
Suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut
But you forgetting sarah, marshall
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court I'll be naked
And square a lawsuit
Judge be like '' that's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you
And jmp your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You so fucking gravy, marshall, I should start calling you "au jus"
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you''
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic K-Mark panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker

And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming ''fuck, shit, fuck''
Adult with a child is like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out
I was like ''merits, fuck that''
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like
''tight [?], screamy eyes''
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
[?] of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies


[Hook:]
There?s darkness closing in (evil twin)
There it goes again (my evil twin),
It controls my pen (my evil twin),
But that ain?t me, it?s my evil twin
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
But he?s just a friend (evil twin),
Who pops up now and again (again)
So don?t blame me (evil twin)
Blame him, it?s my evil twin

[interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2:]
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3?s
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger
My suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorraine said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I'd ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally I bet he registered Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definitely my destiny
When on the steps I met Deshaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?
Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the loony police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone?d finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, Lmfao, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, Oj no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an 8-0-8
And a base whether we're fucking of that instead of your face, so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in the bowling
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitchGirl you gimme writers block
I’m at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can’t be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it’s both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain’t

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don’t wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That’s a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany’s
You better have an epiphanyWhat is a nightmare?
A dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspcious
when I stepped on a crack on [?]
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new begi [?]
Missuri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
from Misuri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen she's like
Let's [?]

But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Dissapear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronney
brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
"I remember clearly, even today"
Move back to Michigan again
chillin' with my Grandma [? Ned]
Always itchin' for something to do. Was flipping
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones
all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, fuck them stupid [?] bitch
it's all about them new edition [?]
You get them hella Cool J [?]
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and [? Hoover]
and somehow I found my future is in this
That's how I know my mission
Little boom box [?] and spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning
my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We tossed a mic that both of us existed to do this shit
Never quid, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with alliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top [?]
If you got dissed at the [?] cos if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin you
And you forgot your written

I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen Slim
[?]

I'm in a league Muhammad's in
All these [?] bombing them
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like [?]
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle
Bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
[?] but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Ooh, no more trippin in bird shit
this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this [?]
The rap games God
but the name's not James Todd? I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
Cos all I got is bars for you dumbbells and doors
ain't working out
Each verse is more [?] than the first
And you ain't got to wear no shoes
and shirt in this beast? to get served

They shall not escape

With the uncle Ron
I'm turning into an humble DonI can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light(Don't kill me)

Thank you!

Go, go, go (what the, f***?)
What the f*** are you doing?
Mothaf***er bail on me? F*** you!

Aw, you gotta be f***ing kidding me
Are you f***ing kidding me?
S***!
Get off

(Haha)

The parking lot
S***, ah!
(Let me see your hands, prank's over)
F*** it![Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro]
‘Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck them all
Tell them all eat shit, here we go again

God damn! Is it that time again already?
Y'all don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck y’all then!

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck,  I want my duck sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble them up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know
That you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve
Sucker, motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, ‘cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on ‘cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song—come on!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mothafucka, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You must've mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot ‘cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, “Shady ease up!
Man, chill!”, naw I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During a earthquake urine in your face
‘Cause you're fake, ah! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
Ah what the fuck! I just got struck by lightnin'
All right then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
“This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you”
And just then the wind blew, and I said...

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
"So long," 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that
Learn the words to the song
"Oh, bitches don't like that," homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns
And the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-tune
The last thing you want to do
Is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, "I was writing this, and I thought of you," so

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made meAyo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too,
God it feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
You're crying out for help

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else 
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up 
All over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.i. Keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like 
I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else. I'm back! Ha ha[Hook: Pink]
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death-bed
Screaming, “F that!” – yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact—well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said: “Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!”
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show them how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

[Hook: Pink]
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gonna get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, mothafucka
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
In other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

[Hook: Pink]
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is light-
-ning and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place, so how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?

[Hook: Pink]
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no[Hook]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1]
Lately I really feel like I'm rollin' for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'
And I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin'
I try and hide it, but I can't
Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty, when inside I'm dyin'?
I am finally realizin' I need help, I can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallyin' around with the idea of endin' the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her… shit

[Hook]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle?
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out
Homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah, Em, tight verse, you killed it!"
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gonna do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then—

[Hook (with Eminem)]
I'm going through changes
(Don’t know what I’m going through
But I just keep on going through changes)
I'm going through changes

[Verse 3]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you
What you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward
Sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one
I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
"Daddy, don't you die on me!
Daddy, better hold your ground!"
Fuck, don't I know the sound
Of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down!

[Hook (with Eminem)]
I'm going through changes
(Don’t know what I’m going through
But I just keep on going through changes)
I'm going through changes

[Verse 4]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
But somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that, what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I woulda never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day
We just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours — yes, it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost as if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away
Don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm—

[Hook (with Eminem)]
I'm going through changes
(Don’t know what I’m going through
But I just keep on going through changes)
I'm going through changes[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or "how can he"
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas: his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole Universe

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
‘Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road[Intro]
(Like a verbal seduction
Seduction when I tell them girls on the floor)
I don't know, man
Just feels like we're a lot different
It kinda feels like
I'm on a whole different page right now than you
It feels strange, but umm
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like…

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, "C'mon, son!"
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants him."
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?

[Hook]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

[Verse 2]
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

[Hook]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

[Verse 3]
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll— wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick… aw, fuck

[Hook]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you[Verse 1]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses
What the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kinda emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

[Hook]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2]
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one, then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake
What the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

[Hook]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3]
So, after a year and six months
It's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin'
I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this:

[Bridge]
And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

[Outro]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you[Intro]
Yeah, you know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
{In the background: Amen, Amen}
Yeah! Ha ha, feels good
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowin' this one
Nah, man, ha ha
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

[Bridge]
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand
Take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock
Take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Verse 1]
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down when I was down, I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick!
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses
'Cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up
Stand behind you like "Whooo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See, you can hate him, he don't blame you
Frankly, he would too
This game couldn't afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

[Hook]
Now guess who? Here's a clue
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella Man
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Music is my time machine, so call me
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Bridge 2]
Fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it
Screamed "Shut up!" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down
And made it rain upward
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Rewound the future to the present
Paused it – don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka
He's the shit right now, he's
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)

[Verse 2]
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old
Can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new
Que será, consider it his last hurrah
The coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I
Will make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm the spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists

[Hook]
Who? Here's a clue
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass
He's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name?
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
If I had a time machine, I'd be
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Music is my time machine, so call me
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)[Intro]
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it

[Spoken: Eminem]
Can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get
To be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but…
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screaming "Attack!"
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but…
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the wacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick' is too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ
Call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Me's
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BB's: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite
Now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention
Of the mighty D.R.E.—he's almost famous

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but…
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin'
Cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters
Showin' no love for these broads
He ain't given them shit
He says he'll pinch a penny so hard he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out: "AHH!"
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie
To hang themselves by: like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fuckin' had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me
Take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward
This whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic
Let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
There's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, “Wait!
Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't
Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me when it comes to love
You're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie[Intro]
Nah man, not quite finished yet

[Verse 1]
Girl, I think you just might've tried
To pull a motherfuckin’ fast one, I’m mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling
And that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryin' to play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway?
Better cooperate or get sauteed
And rotisseried while you’re hog-tied
MC’s get so quiet
You can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin’ Fall Guy
I don’t gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
And run over kids, women, and men – Vrinn-Vrinn!
Motor so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin’?
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it’s gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny’s pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he’s tryin' to roll a snowball
But don’t make him lose his cool
If he hollers, better let him go, y’all

[Hook]
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit – yeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it
Evil – I see, hear, and speak it
Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin’ chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin’
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in
So bad, you’re gonna have Kurt Cobain askin’
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag’s asshole
Now let’s take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he’s cool with it
Don’t stand there and look stupid at
Me, bitch, I ain’t in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up
Y’all are so motherfuckin’ full of shit that you stopped up
Me, I’m always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth
'Til your speakers crap out Pfft, huh, what?
Girl you got a hot butt
Like a lit cigarette (chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won’t get a hot fudge sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut, because–

[Hook]
You don't own me
Here we go, go, go

[Verse 3]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore
I know you want more
Bitch, it’s time to put the math back into Mathers
'Cause I’m a fuckin’ problem – run, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered
So every last word that you fuckin’ fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words, I’m a bass-turd
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gas in the tank, yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse, I really don’t feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable
Why you jealous? Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist him now – can you, ho?
“Shady, I don’t understand your flow.”
Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu’s hair, boy
Don’t you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I’m raw, you ain’t even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point
But you can’t touch, I’m too clairvoyant
I don’t get it, man, is there a void?
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I’m back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember, boys–

[Hook]
You don't own me
Here we go go go

[Outro]
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
Until next time
Peace[Dr. West]
"Morning, Marshall."

[Eminem]
"Morning, doc."

[Dr. West]
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"

[Eminem]
"Ah, anxious."

[Dr. West]
"Anxiety?"

[Eminem]
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."

[Dr. West]
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now
You're sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this
You found a sponsor yet?"

[Eminem]
"Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back..."

[Dr. West]
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."

[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, I mean I gotta start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"

[Dr. West]
"Well, I mean you don't absolutely have to go to meetings, I mean it's not like... a requirement; if they fit into your schedule, I know you're a busy person."

[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing?"

[Dr. West]
"So what else are you thinking?"

[Eminem]
"Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and I mean learn 'em, and start being able to apply 'em."

[Dr. West]
"The steps?"

[Eminem]
"Yeah, the steps."

[Dr. West]
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?"

[Eminem]
"Well, twelve, but–"

[Dr. West]
"Christ, I don't even know them all."

[Eminem]
"Really?"

[Dr. West]
"Anything else?"

[Eminem]
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where, maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that, and I get tempted to—"

[Dr. West]
"Take a drink."

[Eminem]
"What?"

[Dr. West]
"Take a drink, and y'know, take the edge off."

[Eminem]
"Take the edge off? Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."

[Dr. West]
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*

[Eminem]
"No, what the fuck?!"

[Dr. West/Slim Shady]
"Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall? Marshall!!

[Eminem]
"Oh no, no, no! Come on, man!
Oh, fuck you, man!
No, no, no, NO!"
*Alarm beeps*
"Oh, shit!"[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight
Yo, yo
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
"What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?"
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid"

[Bridge]
My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on

[Chorus]
'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Bridge]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

[Verse 3]
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually
What has ended up happening, a tragedy
The fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
But I don't need it "Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up"
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

[Outro]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though
Dr. Dre, 2010
Ay, this shit is hella hard, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
Woo![Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
"We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest," the next day my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid
The bastard won't even eat nothing, he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead"
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course unless you object"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 2]
"Did you get him?" Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? "Yeah" Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady, what the fuck you saying?" I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting
"Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being"
No, Dad, I said no — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene"

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane[Intro]
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk Luis Miguel
Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little Rap and Punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, Crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets
And act like a madman holding a Glad

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachi
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets
And act like a madman holding a Glad bag

[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chit
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins wit'
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets
And act like a madman holding a Glad bag
Oh, bagpipes from Baghdad

[Outro]
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aahHey! hey, stop, hey. please stop, fuck stop!
Thank god you stopped.
Fuck, my fucking on star isn't working,
I left my fucking phone at home!
God, I've been standing out here for like, an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much. Really, you're a life-saver
What are you doing?
Fucking! get away from me! what the fuck! fuckin asshole!
Get away from me you motherfucker! get away!
Get away you fuckin freak! get away from me!
Goddamit fuck! help me![Intro]
Yeah
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight

[Verse 1]
I'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, "Well, hello Tonya"
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'mma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "Hello, my love"
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two wit' me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?

Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?

Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!

Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention

And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim's

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Bridge: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you're checking me out

And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Outro: Eminem]
So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down

Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha ha, woo!
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah![Intro]
Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex, and I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yessir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess I'll dig her fetus out with a wire hanger
Then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 2]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see, man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand big man?
Grab hold of this branch with both hands
Man, they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me, like it's my fault
This name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you (inhale)
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume (inhale)
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far (inhale)
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Outro]
The world is mine[Paul]
Em, what's going on? It's Paul. Um, Dre gave me a copy of the new album. And I just... Fuck it.
[*click*][Intro]
Yo, yo, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold
Oh so cold, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on–ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

[Verse 1]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you might've
Heard of me before, see whore
You're the kind of girl that I'd a–ssault and rape
Then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella
Then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild
But I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah
Now let's see her have triplets, and I'll di–sintegrate them babies
As soon as they're out her with formalde–hyde and cyanide
Girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
Murderin', I'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uhh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull
My knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on–ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

[Verse 2]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's making me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
"Who's waking me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
"He's raping me," she tries to scream
"Somebody please get him off me
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scraping me, she's fighting me
She's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing
To quite a different drum beat

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on–ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

[Verse 3]
Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep
Bitch, your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away
Why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach
Growling from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler
Bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya
With piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye
Beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand
There's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hacking 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's coming in from the back

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

[Chorus]
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on–ly some will go
But none return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake[Intro: Eminem]
Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half.. feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please... undo your seat belt for takeoff [chkk]
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre, from back in the day
From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment
Surprised entirely, hypnotized by the sound
I surround the hydrants, taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again, naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Verse 7: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back – What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just —

[Chorus: Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)[Intro]
Yeah, ohh, yeah yeah, ohh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me (High!)
I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high

[Verse 1]
Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with Exacto
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are getting fulfilled
Ooh, I'm literally getting a chill, spitting at will
Me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know
Who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods
Where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in
How they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, hat kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum
Make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (high)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mindMr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an eighteen-gauge
Left A-C right away

B-P is ninety over twelve
Respiration's at eight
Okay, I'm tubing him

D-M-C, this is medic forty-one

Medic forty-one, this is D-M-C base, go ahead

He's cold
Spike him back and grab the back board

Okay, got it
On three
One, two, three
Let's move[Intro]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready, respiration's eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp, patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA ten minutes

[Verse 1]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium, like, yeah that's great
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
"Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating
3 Musketeers in the rear seat"

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 2]
"Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?"
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
"Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"
And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed, for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck am I hungover, and goddamn, I
Got a headache, shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 3]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then "Ahhh"
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
"Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax"
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby, good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit or come to grips with the fact
That I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow, one tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man-servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place
Every school I went, I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk *like this*
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At eight years old; I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful[Intro: Eminem]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(Okay, let's go!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse
The shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh, my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that six tre, like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
‘Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions—garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent & Eminem]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say "Move," a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from duskMr. Berman?

What?

We have Eminem here to see you

About fuckin' time! Send him in
Steve! Good to see ya, man. Um, hey, I just w–
Well, look who decided to show his face!
I hope you've had fun in the last four years
Look man, I apologize again for–
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
Again, it was a mistake, a terrible mist–
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
And then you go and do what? Hide out?
Stay in Detroit for almost five years
While the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs
Because of your fuckin' vacation?
Well, that's actually why I'm here
I was gonna put out some new music
And I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about: "Poor me!
I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life
And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over!
I'm done talkin' to you!
Think you can just come and go as you please
Big selfish superstar?
Steve, I had a drug problem!
"Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!"
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town?
You know what? (*gun cocks*)
Hey! hey!
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ, man
Alright, alright, here, fine
What's this shit? Two CDs?
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, man, there's two albums
Just get out!
Alright!
Get the fuck out!
Alright, man, see you later[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 1]
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
The fuckin' Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 2]
Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day (hah!)
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? Headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Outro]
So, it wasn't a choice, it was "I had to do this."
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
"When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down."
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
"I just love condoms and lots of cum."
No? Well, shit![Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you
To understand something
That when I come up in this bitch
I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air
I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks
Ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to feel ya up
Are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B
It's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER
We are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow
No not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate
You busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy
Girl, you just hit the lottery

[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us
You can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink
No matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
This is when shit hits the fan
Like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts
Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once
This song’s like a seance, it haunts
(It makes them stay in a trance
No choice, they have to dance)
It's like the playoffs
Just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what?
Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing
Stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor baby
Time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us
You can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink
No matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged
But homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow
Liquid courage
I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the door
Power surges head to toe
I'm sure
To push it as far as words
Are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago
With tinted windows
Ferocious
As we proceed
To beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking
It's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc
Then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle
And knock on your do'

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in
'Fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing
We'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet
Move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak
Move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us
You can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink
No matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose[Intro]
Ahh! You sick asshole let me go
Somebody please! Help
Oh my God, please help me!
"It fits, perfect"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Better watch out
Sucka, now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught coming
And I'm packing in my lunch a
Bunch of missile launchers
And a bunch of contra–band
Van full of ganja
Now come on, jump
Man, stop moshing Marshall
Oh my God, ya
Doing the cha-cha
And the Cucaracha
With a quadra–plegic
Boogying down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan, lick it
While you let me watch ya
Who'da knew
The Buddha'd do
To me what it's done
Such cynicism
When there’s izm
In my system
Blunt hypnotism
Lift the spliff up to my lips, son
So much on my hands
I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo–pher Reeves
Swimming in my swim trunks
"Mister – Help me"
Is what he said to me and then sunk
Women, skinning them
And cutting them up in chunks
In comes
The woman with cocoa butter skin, once

[Hook]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Always
You can see him lurking in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females
In his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all
Into such a small place
Hide 'em in the wall
Well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then
I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries
For the moment I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it
I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas
My regular saw ain't
Now here I come again
Damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits
Coming from within
Someone's in
The back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin
But I want her skin
Vinn
On the hunt again
When
Will it ever end?
Evelyn
Why you trying to fight?
You will never win
Severin'
Legs, arms; damn there goes another limb
Pull the lever then
Trap door, death is evident

[Hook]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothing, so chill
Fucking ho, you better fucking hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffing those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just a-clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fucking told you!
I keep hearing voices
Like "Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish-kabob skewers
Into her
Barbecue her
Would you do to her
What you usually do
To a girl who's skin's newer?"
(In a world of sin you are
This is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts
Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya
'Til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah
Who ya think you're fucking with
Duck because here he comes again

[Hook]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill[Intro]
All aboard!
OK, next stop, my basement
Snap! Haha
I'll meet you down there!

[Hook]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say "What if you went platinum?"
I'd just laugh at him
"That's not happening, that I can't fathom"
Eighty-something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad
They done had enough of Shady
You slay me
Nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me
They use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That’s a no-no
Even she knows
Dada’s fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas
Fuckin' A, B
Maybe it's because
I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby
At another baby
You may think it's 'cause
Of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now
Karmas in the waters
Every line I ever said
Has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya
But it all does
You wouldn't listen, man
I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted
'Cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters
Turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this
I ought to just be honest
But

[Hook]
There once was a saying that I used to say

[Verse 2]
"Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots"
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent
To Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em
A fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass
Hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient
Get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße
Ask Doctor Dreizehn
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe, I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact same, check it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house
I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up
A hamster in the microwave, I
Thinking 'bout an escalator now
Steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away
Then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like, now mothafucka, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker (Baa) Try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator
Take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em
Just to cut the fucking cable
Let 'em plop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator
Get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement
Yelling "Stop!"

[Hook]
There once was a saying that I used to say

[Outro]
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
The shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator[Intro]
Yo...Dre Man..Make my vocals sound sexy
Come on man, come on man, okaaaay

[Hook]
It feels so wrong cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's ok with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl, now lets cuddle
Blood curdlin', your gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' won-der-ful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the valentines day massacre
Slash assassin, I slash her in the ass with a
Icicle and leave her layin' a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my spiderman mask man, just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachio's damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio man, rolling a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on
God damn man, are you that much of an asshole?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from jupiter
I'm tryna to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Weenier smothered in peanut butter puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man it looked nice, you should've seen it mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap and watch The Sopranos

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM!
And assumin' the fact that that dudes in the back room
Usin' the bathroom vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk?
Cause I'm scared there's monster's under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dike? Well I can pee pee and write your name

[Hook]

Fine nobody wants to play with me
Fuck you then bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me...make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry...I'm crying
I'm going' tell my mom....mom[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that?
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes you not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[Hook]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box, my music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl’s asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won’t you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked, and run around
Waving the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

[Hook]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box, my music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl’s asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won’t you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin' this little chick's neck
Like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like "Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula"
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

[Hook]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box, my music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl’s asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won’t you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Bluh! Bluh-Bluh! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God
Fucking bumbaclot
I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire
You're nothing but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal
And Charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch
I'm like Chef Boyardee in this bitch
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy
You think you're Tom Sawyer
Until I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' ficti-tional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself
For Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction
It's fact boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield
Equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce, and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch
Zip, zero, nothing; no, nada
Like your fatha fucking your motha

[Hook]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy
You little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise
Here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys
The rap Crown Royals
That scalp cowboys
Now, how that sound for you?
Yeah boy, you know we're about to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer
Have a sound voyage
And sayonara
See you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R
And marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile
Don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on you
That's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most
Boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy
Them boys, them no up to par
I just show up
Go up to the stage
And blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do
Boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy
I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch
I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy
Fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy
You didn't go there, no you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you
Boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got
Whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy
Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin'
Ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot
When the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop
And when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Hook]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself
Boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell
Boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell
Boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringing hell
Boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds
Who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy
In a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever
The cheddar shredder
The grater
The beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later
Giving haters incubators
Think you made a mistake
By saying Shady was ghost
I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave
Just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place
To Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit?
Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady fucking Aftermath, boy
The ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Hook]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me[Intro]
"Breaking news
Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour
To check himself into rehab
After admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops"
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice
Has apparently survived a gunshot to the head
In what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated
On again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier
About gunfire at an after-hours club
We've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem
And a member of the rap group D12"
"D12, back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end?
The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break
But doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was raking in the dough, rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3 then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-foldCut the f***in’ music up

Is anybody out there!?Of all the things that you could choose to say
?Baby come home with me for old time sake?
?Stand by my side and flash me that smile?
?Everybody is out tonight?

So I called you up from god knows where
Would you lie in bed if I were there
Speak soft, just talk I will listen
Don't you dare leave till the morning
Like you always do

Follow me down through the streets of the states
Make up a reason not to come for old time sake
Nothing in this town could ever change
Except maybe new lines on your face

So I called you up from god knows where
Would you lie in bed if I were there
Speak soft, just talk I will listen
Don't you dare leave till the morning
Like you always doMr. Berman?

What?

We have Eminem here to see you

About fuckin' time! Send him in
Steve! Good to see ya, man. Um, hey, I just w–
Well, look who decided to show his face!
I hope you've had fun in the last four years
Look man, I apologize again for–
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
Again, it was a mistake, a terrible mist–
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
And then you go and do what? Hide out?
Stay in Detroit for almost five years
While the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs
Because of your fuckin' vacation?
Well, that's actually why I'm here
I was gonna put out some new music
And I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about: "Poor me!
I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life
And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over!
I'm done talkin' to you!
Think you can just come and go as you please
Big selfish superstar?
Steve, I had a drug problem!
"Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!"
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town?
You know what? (*gun cocks*)
Hey! hey!
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ, man
Alright, alright, here, fine
What's this shit? Two CDs?
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, man, there's two albums
Just get out!
Alright!
Get the fuck out!
Alright, man, see you laterApplause

Still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
Alright, let's do it
Let's go, come on
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem)[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
Well, Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they ganged up on me and sang this song
Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song
It went a little something like, "Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn"
Momma why do they keep saying this? I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between
Predominantly both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like, some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tuch mullbish
"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion, and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it"
Shit, if you only knew the half of it

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know why they feel like they know me, 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on? This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me, for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Outro]
[gunshot, crowd cheering] Oh!
Last one baby, let's go
Detroit![Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zy
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
Get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough[Intro]
"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children."
"We seem to be approaching an age of the gross." {burp}
"We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' nation and each generation should do a little bit better."

[Verse 1]
Alright, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape and
Its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music that we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the east side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2]
I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke and steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim, had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my Mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne, handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
With compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 3]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J, Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next?
X Clan debuted, Professor X (vanglorious)
Exists in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!
Now with this being a new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butta would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was being laughed at
"You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!"
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
Sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryna two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school
Who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even goin' say it, plus, the same color hair as hers
Was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the
Same time; but it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the "Oh Foolish Pride" girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a ho

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home[Intro]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders, I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' {Suge}
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute, ‘cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, ‘cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated — it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it!
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up
‘Cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws, well, then I can, ‘cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not goin' to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
‘Cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers[Intro: Kids' voices + Eminem]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands
People! It feels so good to be back!
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all
Mosh with me now!

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, moving past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband Man – yeah, he just snaps back

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain – yeah, the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't
We're stronger now more than ever
They tell us "No!" we say "Yeah!"
They tell us "Stop!" we say "Go!"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just—

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster
This coward that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six
-teen million people, all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country
We're patronizin' a hero; look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why—‘cause I told you to fight!

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Outro]
And as we precede
To mosh through this Desert Storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President! Mr. Senator!

[Over outro]
"Go left, go left, go left, right, left"
"Go left, go left, go left, right, left"

[Kids]
Can you guys hear us? *laughs*[Intro]
*Eminem puking into a toilet*
There I go--thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song--whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'mma start right here I'll just be brief I'm
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
On my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece a
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking coke-head slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna
Yack-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack
What else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now, all I wanna do
Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

Fucking bitch[Intro]
Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That them horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Ms. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves just for no reason
Other than just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest [belching] fan
He used to be Superman, now we're pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco stompin' and stampedin'
Up the damn street like them buffalo soldiers
I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers is dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked them away {*slam*}
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I coulda told ya to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Hook]
And this was supposed to be my first single {*burp*}
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle! {*burp*}
Slap a bitch and smack a ho!
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle {*fart*}
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle {*fart*}
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no {erra}
Oh, ah {erra} oh, ah {erra}

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare naked
{chiga chigga Jigga jigga}
Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly – he he he he he he
To be so young and naive!
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory dickory Dirk Diggler
Look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or {chiga chigga chig chig jer chig jer} jerkin' the chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – well, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the damn
Camera, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle {chigga chigga}
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin'
When they were just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with them
'Cause they coulda sworn someone said
Nuh – and then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
Uhh, uhh, and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', "I'm gonna cum!"

[Hook]
And this was supposed to be my first single {*burp*}
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle! {*burp*}

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics? I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm-A-Dick-Sucker, I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay, and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, ba-ca-BA-KAWK!
Or suck a dick and lick a dick
And eat a dick and stick a dick
In your mouth; I'm done, you can fuck off, fucka-FUCK-OFF!

Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope

Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for findin' me offensive
Hence if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extents if any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Bein' on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths, this
Far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christo-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth musta put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Hook]
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is:
Rain Man

[Verse 2]
Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say
And what not to say
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (What up?), I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But, up I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay
I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

[Hook]
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is:
Rain Man

[Verse 3]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is tellin me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
God damnit Dre, where's the God damned beat (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoom, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

[Hook]
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is:
Rain Man

[Outro]
Cause ah ha ha ha ha
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope, beatmaker
Two thousand, two thousand four-hundred and eighty-seven million
Nine hundred and se-seventy-three thousand four hundred and sixty-three
...and seventy (yeah)[Intro]
I don't understand! Why are you being so MEAN?
You're a MEAN, MEAN MAN!

[Hook]
You are just jealous of me cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only cause you're, just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open, your mind - your eyes close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo? Pippity ga-ga poo-poo
Psych I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question - why do I always sense this
Undeniable tension, from the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was - I fucked up
Psych I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I FUCKED up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something, what? You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on? You sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How about now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room
Somewhere crying, curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
My point is this - that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

[Hook]

Get the fuck off my dick![Intro]
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
Down okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot," it's okay
*fart sound* Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Verse 2]
It's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna (touch my body)
Excuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
(Man, you must be up out your mind)
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm…

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Verse 3]
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said "Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady" (Touch my body!)
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, there's B. Rabbit!
"Oh, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!"
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chuba tellytubby
Fellas! (what?) fellas! (what?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go (ah ah ah ah); it's so appeasin'

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Outro]
Touch my body
Touch my body
Oooh boy, touch my body
I mean girl, touch my bodyReporter: Eminem, Eminem, over here, over here, so how do you feel about your album?
Triumph: Yes, I have a question, as a dog I must know what does Dr. Dre's ass smell like? You're so cute and small, no wonder Elton John loves you, your head comes up to his waist!
Eminem: Yeah fuck off, so anyway--
Triumph: Do you kiss 50 Cent with that mouth?
Triumph: I'm not your wife!

[Hook]
Aw, baby
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Do-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Do-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying 'freeze!': do-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it! (You will love it)

[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Do-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
Do-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying 'freeze!': do-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
'Cause there's a puppet on my hand (ha-ha)

[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Do-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen her butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
Do-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': do-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Psych! I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down!

[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Dr. Dre: The fuck is wrong witchu?
Eminem: Ha! Ha!
Triumph: Hey blondie, I saved your peroxide ass again![Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold?
But bitches, they gon' talk; niggas, they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and—

[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that?
Who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart, but when someone seems
Too good to be true, they usually are, but see
When you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha ha, yeah right, bitch!
Spend some time with my dick!

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is "Fuck a bitch!"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was diff-er-ent, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shorty on some whole nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who coulda predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: "Do I love these hoes?" — NOPE!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Em introduced us: "50, this is Tonya. Tonya, this is 50."
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said: "You have very nice lips."
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist, too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?

[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"[Intro]
"Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me."

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever being
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
(Heh, it's funny)

[Verse 2]
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (ha ha)[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe
Because you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty-four, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey man) {*chk-chk-BOOM*} That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Kuniva & (Eminem)]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping
(Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Swift & (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?
{*gunfire*} Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
{*crash*} And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Maaaaan! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'mma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
{*blam*} God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off*People chanting eminem* 
*Paper folding/tearing* 
*Footsteps* 
*Door open and slam shut* 

*More footsteps* 
*Gun reloading* 

*sigh*[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman Pinscher and a Pit Bull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tatooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President {dead}
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been bastard
The shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fucking automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack-click!

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
*sshhhhh* I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Hook]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live

Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that
I don't explode and, have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that
They all trying get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common that we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence it is, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was, hollering, "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when, they were still making, Maxell casettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stopYo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
A'ight, let's go
Lets go, c'mon[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

[Hook]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (ooh, baby!) — look at my sales!
Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at!
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
"Fuck it," until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just startin' to work to my benefit now?

[Hook]
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot," shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

[Hook]
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Deringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the ​​flag​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!

Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile – let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't want to be
Anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Hook: Eminem]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on
In Gotham when I'm gone
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Hook: Eminem]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone! Thank you for coming!
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have: I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed him, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin', goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely, and Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral!
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet[Produced by Eminem & Jeff Bass]

[Intro]
People, it feels so good to be back!
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and improved you-know-who

[Verse 1]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim, nooo!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From seance to seance, aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back
Boo! The boogie monster of Rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right
To say somethin' you might not like
This white hot light that I'm under
No wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinking that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

[Verse 3]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me—stab me, shoot at me!
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da, but you gotta gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny: I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fuckin'!

[Hook]
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry about
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now! Let's all get on down!
Let's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time

[Outro]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Cani-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-bis don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you

"I'm gonna kill this bitch, I'm gonna kill her. I'm going to fucking jail 'cause I'm gonna kill this bitch!"
"Yo, man..."
"What?"
"I don't know, I got a really, really bad feeling about this..."
"Man, would you shut the fuck up, Gary!? You always got a bad feeling, man..! That's her car right there, just park."
"Alright, just let me park... I'm parking!"
"Fucking turn the car off, dawg."
"Alright..."
"Alright, we wait."
"We wait for what?"
"We wait until she comes out and then I'm gonna fucking kill her."
"Man... you ain't gonna kill no one—what the fuck did you bring that for!?"
"Man, shut the fuck up, dawg, just shut up. Fucking clip is empty, it's not—" [Eminem reveals and empties gun clip.]
"Man, don't point that shit at me!"
"It's not even loaded bitch, look." [Eminem shoots gun, gun jams.]
"Dude! God, I fucking hate when you do that shit!"
"Yeah, but it's funny as fuck!"
"Gonna fuck around and kill me one of these days, I swear..."
"Gets you every time."

["Soldier" theme begins to play.]
"Is that her?"
"Where?"
"Right there, motherfucker."
"Oh, yeah..."
"Alright, get down, get down."
"Fuck, here we go again..."
"Get down!"
"The fuck? You want me to get under the car?"
"Yo, who's she walking with..?"
"The fuck am I supposed to know? You told me to duck down!"
"It's the fucking bouncer—did she just kiss him?"
"I don't think so."
"Dawg, sh... She just fucking kissed him!"
"No, she didn't."
"She's kissing him, dawg. Y—Fuck this..." [Eminem exits car.]
"No, she's not—Aw, shit..."
"Come on." [Eminem runs off yelling "motherfucker!"]

I'm a soldier

Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your rap's what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Bein' reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty
Tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not, 'cause I'm a

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a

Saying goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standing here swinging on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashing the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now

Bury my face in comic books, ‘cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter, laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps
Of my dad, ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
"Publicity stunt" my ass, "conceal" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein' everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fucking crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had
Instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm saying

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!!!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Outro]
Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la
Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la
Kids!Em, it's Paul
Listen, 
Joel just called me 
And he told me you're in the fuckin' back, behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fuckin' bring your gun around
Like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself on trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home 
You can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home[Verse 1]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
‘Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you!

[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Sing this shit!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it?
How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry, at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment
Try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
‘Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away[Intro: Eminem & (Dina Rae)]
(Mhmmm) *inhales*
You high, baby? (Yeah)
Yeah? (Talk to me!)
You want me to tell you something? (Uh huh)
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem & (Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I be in
We'll see how much you be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: (I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me)
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
(Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great)
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day

Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
‘Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy? Oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no

[Hook]
‘Cause sometimes it feels
Like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels
Like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no

[Hook]
‘Cause sometimes it feels
Like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels
Like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *want her*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled
That hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted
Is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs
Bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up
If I'd have seen what she was fuckin', but fuck it
It's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted

[Hook 2]
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what, Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers
Have a responsibility to these kids... Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no getting rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemies' crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbours for acres
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dying – you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends
Turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Begging with their hands out
Checking for your record when it's selling
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink till your car spin
You think "Damn!" when you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you with a pistol
Sipping a can of penzoil
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy-wagon
Bragging about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype, popping shit in broad daylight
Nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "Woof!"
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
NWA said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
Ninety-three was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson – who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flying down Sunset, smoking crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose
And a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock
I'm reaching for the Glock, but the music stops {*blam*}[Intro: Eminem]
‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who want some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me[Interlude: Television Show]
"Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do..! Who's your daddy?"
"Daddy, what are you doing?"

[Intro: Hailie Jade + Eminem]
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm going to Hell! Who's coming with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, (Hailie Jade) & (Dr. Dre)]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!)
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!)
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
{*knocking*} Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)

[Hook: Eminem + Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine
And goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!
… Uh… Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face, with a clit
Ring in my nose than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-minie-moe
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? (Dad!)

[Hook: Eminem + Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say
I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade
Won't you tell 'em, baby?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say
That could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me
Not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 3]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme
See, what you're seein' is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
‘Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain
Than the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
The parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed
In two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Hook: Eminem + Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say
I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade
Won't you tell 'em, baby?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say
That could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me
Not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy!
Crazy!

[Outro: Hailie Jade]
Ha ha ha ha!
You're funny, Daddy!(Eminem)
Is this thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back?
Back again·.
Ken is back, tell some·men
Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back·.
Eh·.Wait·..Hello?
Eh·..Goodnight(Same announcer as the first Public Service

Eminem (whispered): tell em i'm fed up

Eminem (whispered): yeah
Announcer: uh...anything else?
Eminem: Yeah...SUE ME![Produced by Mark the 45 King]

[Hook: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Hook: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous ‘cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

[Hook: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word — I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together — think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See, Slim— shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Hook: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was… it was you, damn[Intro]
(I never knew I) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I) Who would've knew?
(I never knew I) Who would've known?
(I never knew I) Fuck would've thought?
(I never knew I) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I) And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music: this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

[Hook]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I sees three little kids up in the front row
Screaming "Go!" with their 17-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And "fuck" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

[Hook]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 3]
I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop!
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeve
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

[Hook]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Outro]
How the fuck was I supposed to know?Hey!
Hey Em what's up?
Steve Berman what's goin' on man?
How you doin'? Good to see you again what's up?
Em could you come here and have a seat please?
Um yeah what's?
Vanessa shut the door
Okay
So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
What?
This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record!
What?
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wha-what's the problem?
Violet Brown told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violet...
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
But I...
I'm gonna lose my fucking job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rapping about big-screen TV's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rapping about homosexuals and Vicodin
I mean...
I can't sell this shit!
What...
Either change the record or it's not coming out!
What I-
Now get the fuck out of my office!
What am I supposed...
Now!
Alright man[Produced by Eminem]

[Intro]
…Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone
Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Hook]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

[Hook]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Hook]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture {Aww!}
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Hook]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up!

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man][Intro]
You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here!

[Hook]
You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him ‘cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off ‘cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded?
Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (ha-ha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin': "I don't care, just bite me!" (na na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear
In faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns ‘cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back
When they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

[Hook 2]
‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy!
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got I've gone pop
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy."
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, {your attorney Fred Gibson's a} faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Um, here, "XXL! XXL!"
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

[Hook]
‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Hook]
‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)Uhh yeah, uhh suck it
Oh fuck yeah, oh Shaggy
Uhh, this is why they call you '2 Dope', ain't it?
Uhh, fuck yeah
Uhh, take it out, take it out
Uhh, now give something to Jay
Uhh, Violent Jay
Don't bite it, don't be violent with it
Ow, just suck it, nice and slow, yeah
Uhh, uhh, fuck yeah
You got, uhh, now give it back to Shaggy
He was sucking it better
Uhh, now say my name
Eminem!
Say my name
Eminem!
What? Oh, fuck you guys!
Give me my dick back!
Fuck you guys!
Ken!
If you want Eminem, you can have Eminem!
Fuck you guys, I'm leaving!
No! Ken wait! Oh, damn!
Nice going, Shaggy![Intro]
Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
(Aight, guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this)

[Verse 1]
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
(Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so)

[Hook]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no"
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

[Verse 2]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably going
To catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm going to try to find some more

[Hook]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no"
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

[Verse 3]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

[Hook]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no"
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me[Intro: Eminem]

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick (SMACK)
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was asleep
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal (you fucking homo)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker popping some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fucking shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibers here
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year
Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
And that's when accidents happen
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around and they found you
And your family in it
GOD DAMMIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU

[Hook: Eminem]
Mentally ill from Amityville (He'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (He's)

Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, you know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til mothafuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
Came a long way, to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre, but I…

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Somehow, some way
Holla, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns
And I love all of 'em the same, bang bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fuck that)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem
(What's up? What up, Cuz? What up, Snoop!)
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast
Baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage
With ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it ‘cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God's
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees; come on!

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Aww, naww, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human bein' in me
It just can't be found so the reason you've been seein' this me
Is ‘cause this is me now, the recent dude who's bein' this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club ‘cause they know
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again
I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem + (Kim)]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?!
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!"
But not for him to take my place — are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now!  (No!)  I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!)  Shut the fuck up!  (You're drunk!
You're never gonna get away with this!)  You think I give a fuck?!
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch!  (No!)  Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back — well, I will, you'll be in the trunk!

[Hook: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem + (Kim)]
You really fucked me, Kim! You really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!  (I love you!)  Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!)  What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke?  (No!)
There's a {four}-year-old little {boy}
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you?  (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you?  (It's not that!)  No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!)  Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!)  How the fuck could you do this to me?!

[Hook: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 3: Eminem + (Kim)]
Come on, get out!  (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch!  (Let go of my hair!
Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!
Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)  Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm crackin' up — get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it?  (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?!  (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife, and during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced  (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only makin' this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help!"
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!!!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed!!! Bleed, bitch, bleed!!! Bleed!!!

I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without youSo you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick!

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
It's just too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed will hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin', nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats
BMI my publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', "Kuniva, yo, yo!"
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
D12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? ‘Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulgin'
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it? Checkin' the male?"
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing ‘cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
And to think, it's just lil old me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

[Hook]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, ‘cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word ______
My morals went *pffft* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
"The Maniac's in" in place of the Doctor
‘Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
Guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

[Skit]
ROBBER: Aight look, just go up in that motherfucker, get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
EMINEM: Alright
ROBBER: I’ll be right here waiting on you
EMINEM: Aight
ROBBER: Yo, Em
EMINEM: What?!
ROBBER: Don't kill nobody this time
EMINEM: Awwright… goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves!
{*Whistling*} How you doin'?
TELLER: Hi, how can I help you?
EMINEM: Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
TELLER: Okay
EMINEM: Put the fucking money in the bag, bitch, and I won’t kill you!
TELLER: What? Oh my God, don’t kill me!
EMINEM: I’m not gonna kill you, bitch, quit looking around
TELLER: Don’t kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me!
EMINEM: I said I’m not gonna fucking kill you
TELLER: Don't kill me!
EMINEM: Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!
Go, go, go!

[Verse 3]
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

[Hook]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
(I am) A criminal!Hey, what's going on, this is Paul Rosenberger, attorney of
law. Listen, I listened to the rough copy of your album And
uh, you know I've just got to be honest with you Can you tone
it down a little bit? Because there's only so much I can
explain. Give me a call.
Uhh yeah, uhh suck it
Oh fuck yeah, oh Shaggy
Uhh, this is why they call you '2 Dope', ain't it?
Uhh, fuck yeah
Uhh, take it out, take it out
Uhh, now give something to Jay
Uhh, Violent Jay
Don't bite it, don't be violent with it
Ow, just suck it, nice and slow, yeah
Uhh, uhh, fuck yeah

He was sucking it better
Uhh, now say my name

Fuck you guys!
Ken!
If you want Eminem, you can have Eminem!
Fuck you guys, I'm leaving!
No! Ken wait! Oh, damn!
Nice going, Shaggy![Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down!
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please!
Brian, don't throw that! (SHUT UP!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE GOT AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (FUCK YOU!)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?) Say hi Bob! ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks
(AHH!) And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said: "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any—it's bad for you

[Hook]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on!)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right!)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will!)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right!)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along!)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull {​​​*blblblblblb*}​​​
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' {​​​*BLEH*}​​​
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting the money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Hook: Teacher]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right!)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can!)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will!)
So kids say no to drugs (Smoke crack!)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right!)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm…)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dump (Gross!!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Hook]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask!)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will!)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no!)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right!)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (SHUT UP!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad
(South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
(So fucked up right now…)(Same announcer as the first Public Service Announcement on the Slim Shady
Lp)

Announcer: This is another public service announcement brought to you, in
Part, by Slim Shady

Eminem: (whispered): Tell 'em I don't give a fuck

Announcer: Slim Shady does not give a fuck... What you think!

Eminem: Tell 'em to suck it

Announcer: If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking c***!
Eminem: Tell 'em they kissed my ass

Announcer: Little did you know, upon purchasing this album, you have just
Kissed his ass!

Eminem: Tell 'em I'm fed up

Announcer: Slim Shady is fed up with your shit... And he's going to kill you!

[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Verse 1]
Hi, kids! Do you like violence? Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
‘Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut! "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (GET 'EM!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

[Intro: Mark Avery]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in he has a sudden change of heart, and suddenly his conscience comes into play.

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Alright, stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(But who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience!

[Eminem]
That's nonsense!
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

[Eminem]
Fuck that, do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

[Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
(You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude)

[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play.

[Verse 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail!

[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man. (What the fuck?)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
‘Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady! Where's your gun at?[Intro: Doctor and Nurse]
D: Scalpel
N: Here
D: Sponge
N: Here
D: Wait… he's convulsing, he's convulsing
N: Ah!
D: We're gonna have to shock him
N: Oh my! Oh my God!
D: We're gonna have to shock him
N: Oh my God!

[Verse 1]
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts (Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse!)
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
‘Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said: "It's you and I
Three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
"I already gave you my lunch money!
What more do you want from me?"
He said: "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me: "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works!"
I screamed: "Oww! My appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher! Quick, I need a naked nurse"
"What's the matter?" — I don't know, my leg, it hurts
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
But don't you wanna give me after school detention?
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him"

[Hook]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, ‘cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said: "You gonna die, honky!"
The Principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose
And ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin': "What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you! You're gettin' blood all over my rug!" (sorry!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed: "Look, bitch, what have you done?!"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son!" — shut up, you cunt!
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

[Hook]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

[Outro]
Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damageJust the two of us.. (8x)

[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. (2x)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of them except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out
(Wahh!)
I told you it's okay Hai Hai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. (2x)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. Wheeeeee! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. (2x)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2x)
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. (4x)

[Eminem]
Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I'ma always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recording?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous
So when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fucking legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
‘Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked
More than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Hook 1]
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms then OD
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it!) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh; either I'm high
Or I'm nuts, ‘cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer
Shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
‘Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

[Hook 2]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me*Key*
[G] Eminem as Susan (the girl)
[D] Eminem as Dave
[J] Eminem as John
[R] Eminem as Ron

[Hook: Eminem]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe
With half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid
And tied up with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan – an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was going back into using again (Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen!
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here" "Who's in the den?"
[R] "It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"
[G] I don't trust you!
"Shut up, slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods
[G] Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab
"Oh dag"
[G] What
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"
[G] Huh?

[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 2]
"Yo Sue"
[G] Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping
[G] I need to go puke (bleahh)
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying! I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out
She said
[G] Help me, I think I'm having a seizure
I said, I'm high too bitch, quit grabbing my T-shirt! (let go!)
Would you calm down, you're starting to scare me
She said
[G] I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello) I'm over here, Sue, (hi) you're talking to the plant! Look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
‘Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate

[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (whoops!)
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (it’s an accident!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 3]
Susan (wait) Where you going? You better be careful
[G] Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these (I'ma kill him!)
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you"
[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's taking a crap, dude
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?"
[D] Well, it depends on how many you had
"I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
[D] She's gonna die dude
"I know and it's my fault!"
[D] Oh my God!!!

[Hook]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry!)
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
Susan please wake up! Please!
Please wake up!!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead!
Wake up, Susan, wake up! Oh God

[Spoken Outro][Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
Yo, mic check, testing
One, two, um… twelve
Whattup whattup whattup! (Outsidaz)
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)
Alright, aye, turn my headphones up

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I can’t stand white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
‘Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!

[Hook]
Cum on everybody
(Get down tonight)

[Verse 2]
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
‘Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screaming, "I suck!"
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud: "All y'all get the hell out now!"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party!)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded
Like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

[Hook]
Cum on everybody
(Get down tonight)

[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
‘Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be!"
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster."
Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (*brrrrrrring, click*)
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Hook]
Cum on everybody
(Get down tonight)[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people
Who have real nice lives
And have no idea
What it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm about to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers — maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
‘Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass spineless

[Hook]
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
‘Cause you're mad enough to scream
But you're sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it — if you know the rules to the game, play!
‘Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
‘Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Hook]
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
‘Cause you're mad enough to scream
But you're sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I'll end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flames
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
‘Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems — now everybody on my block's got 'em
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch — you want 'em?
‘Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn, with guns drawn

[Hook]
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
‘Cause you're mad enough to scream
But you're sad enough to tear[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (hi, Marshall)
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet, ‘cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back
Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you gon' get stuck, stole, and snuffed
‘Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat—gentlemen, hold your pistols!
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady; Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back
Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed
I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody, let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back
Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed
I just don't give a fuck

[Outro: Eminem]
Shit, fuck everybody!
Outsidaz, Pacewon, Young Zee
(Fuck the entire world!) DU[Hook]
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

[Interlude/Collision]
Yes, man! As the world turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations that we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
‘Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
They never should've booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
(Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
‘Cause I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson! I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said: "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed."
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board
And tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

[Hook]
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

[Interlude/Collision]
As the world turns, these are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through, day by day

[Verse 2]
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape
From their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
‘Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white, trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said: "What up? It's nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month
But if you would care to join me
I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money
And don't try nothing funny, ‘cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me."
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me
With an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parking lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now
She said: "Come in! It's unlocked."
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said: "Come here, big boy! Let's get acquainted!"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg: "No, please let go!"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time
Then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted: "Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best!"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
(Come here, bitch, come here!
Take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here!)

[Hook]
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

[Interlude/Collision]
And as we go along, throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through, these are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere, every day
Every single day the world keeps turning[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little 'home away from home'
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said...

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peakin'
On speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse in my past life
When the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked
It's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

[Hook 1: Eminem]
‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law ‘cause I don't agree with police either
(Shit, me neither)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, ‘cause I can't find a decent vein

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny
Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
‘Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred
Man, until they joint chains, while slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it
Murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

[Spoken: Eminem]
Hello? Ayo, what’s up?
We’re coming to get you!
Stop! THEY KNOW IT’S US!!!

[Verse 5: Eminem]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down, well, I'm out now
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

[Hook 2: Royce da 5'9"]
‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell
Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady
See you in Hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)

[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid
Look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shhh…  wait, did y'all hear that?A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
‘Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body-pierce with this
Livin' amok, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah!)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you until you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains (shh)
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
‘Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (Here, Momma, try 'em on)
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches!
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck! I was born during an earthquake

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass[Intro]
Yo, mic-check
Testing, one, two… fuck
My dick… my nuts…

[Verse 1]
My attitude is worse than N.W.A's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit
And diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
Like Cool J does (my tattoo!)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin': "Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"
I look at my life in a new light
Fuck it, give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
‘Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin' to get my porno career started
Every place and event—been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson 1: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson 2: Face 'em and diss 'em
Don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson 3: Get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus
And put yours on the owner's table
Lesson 4: Know you heard this before
"Hey, let me get your number! I'll call you tomorrow for sure"
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as whack as you can
Lesson 5: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass
When I'm spittin', ‘cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (UNNNGGGGH)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones
And stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said "See ya!"
‘Cause Brandy and Monica walked in
And caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphonin' gas
For your lawn mower to cut the grass

[Hook]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Verse 2]
What a wonderful day! I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi, Renée! I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?
Blood drippin' from it
Rippin' your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip [Mystikal's] voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch—it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah, I don't think this guy is well"
I'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat
When I'm swingin' him by his tail
I'll fuckin'… I'll fuckin'… lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teethin' with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeedin'
And gave her the flesh-eatin' disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to bein' shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked; and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke

[Hook]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (hi, Marshall)
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet, ‘cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back
Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you gon' get stuck, stole, and snuffed
‘Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat—gentlemen, hold your pistols!
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady; Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world!" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck

But see me on the street and duck
‘Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed
I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody, let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks

[Outro: Eminem]
Shit, fuck everybody!
Outsidaz, Pacewon, Young Zee
(Fuck the entire world!) DUJustin? It's Zoe
Um, Kelly did not have me call, however
I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell them how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch
GoodbyeYo, mic check
Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
Alright, turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list
You want to get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin', "I suck"
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud, "All of y'all, get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D, they was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be"
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'til I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

(Shit, fuck everyone)
Outsiders
Pace one
Young Zee (fuck the entire world)A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
‘Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body-pierce with this
Livin' amok, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah!)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you until you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains (shh)
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
‘Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (Here, Momma, try 'em on)
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches!
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck! I was born during an earthquake

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my assYou sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuck, your beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
We doin' this once
Your beard's weird, why you yellin' at the mic?

Rihanna just hit me on the text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me, I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next, damn
I'm really sorry
You want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordictrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter
I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope
But you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo"
So before you die
let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (Slim, you're old)
Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45
And I'm still outselling you
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel
To my bone marrow
Gun, I bet you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me
Like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
Playin' dead
That's the only time you hold still
Are you eating cereal... or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk?
Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly
I need reading material
Dictionary
Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know?
Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you're the whack me
It's funny, but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm getting old-aged still can fill
A whole page with a 10 year old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake
I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy ho
You about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again
And ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch
mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Bein' rich, aimed by some prick
Usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss
'Cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back
Aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
It's your moment, this is it
As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three
Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be this solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo
when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun
when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady
He's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero
We can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse
On the mic to write, not alike
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it, Kells?
Attempt fails, budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins
As soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills
And tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' whack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Autotune, so let's talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it
(Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror
And think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth
And keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'... oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy, you know I love youJumped out of the second floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and hence the origin of the headless horseman
Born with the endorphin's of a pathetic orphan
Endless sores and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have been vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores in sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in
Self absorption
Skeletor, I went to hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus
Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes of course, I mess up once
You want some? Come and get some, boys
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back
His whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm desert storm
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible, hello gorgeous
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible"
Expired tags on the Saturn
Got Kathryn Beck in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter, laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid...

You got it twisted
All 'cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic
Bitch get to massagin' this dick
Like spas in this bitch
Slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit like I've gone ballistic
With a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one
I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets
Trouble 'cause a double cross
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to 'cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results
As Rainman's is
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage"
What's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona
To my last DNA strand, E&J in the waistband
At the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa
Pre-arrange an escape plan
Three inch blade on point like a Sensei
Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one

Great idea!

If I was president
Gettin' off is the first order of business
Once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck safe sex," throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned
And make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it
I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'till I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The board hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
'Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The rock cuts into rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelling quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face 'till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly I'm gone off you
Man light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track

Why am I such a dick?
