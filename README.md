# MachineLearningLyricPrediction

Summary: This project uses an N-Gram model and a neural network model to generate fake lyrics based off of four different artists. We then compared the lyrics generated by each model using perplexity and qualitative analysis, eventually deciding that the N-Gram model was qualitatively better.

Sample Lyrics (Using the N-Gram model on lyrics by Queen):

Line 1: ( yeah ! ) you 're just ca n't no more no , yeah <br>
Line 2: when your life is a little rain must go to me live forever forever <br>
Line 3: i want some of your mother nature does n't stop at home tonight my <br>
Line 4: you can be a good thing i know , you know what you make <br>
Line 5: i 'll never never seen the end we are all your mother nature does <br>

Timeframe: March 2020 - May 2020
