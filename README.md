# MachineLearningLyricPrediction

Summary: This project uses an N-Gram model and a neural network model to generate fake lyrics based off of four different artists. We then compared the lyrics generated by each model using perplexity and qualitative analysis, eventually deciding that the N-Gram model was qualitatively better.

Sample Lyrics (Using the N-Gram model on lyrics by Drake):
